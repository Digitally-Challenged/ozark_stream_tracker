# Project Overview

- **Purpose**: An application to track and display real-time data and conditions for mountain streams, likely in the Ozark region, primarily for recreational water activities like kayaking. It provides information such as flow rates, water levels, temperature, and stream ratings.
- **Target Users**: Kayakers, canoers, anglers, and other outdoor enthusiasts interested in current water conditions for specific streams.
- **Core Features**:
  - Displaying a sortable and searchable table of water streams.
  - Showing detailed real-time information for selected streams (flow, temperature, USGS gauge data).
  - Dark/Light mode theme switching.
  - Filtering capabilities for streams (sidebar exists, full functionality to be confirmed).
  - Tooltips providing definitions for stream characteristics (size, rating, quality, level).
  - Integration with USGS API for live gauge data.
- **Current State**: Partially functional. Displays stream data and fetches live information from USGS. Basic UI and routing are in place. Appears to be a project potentially started with AI assistance, now needing review and optimization. No automated tests are present.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - React `18.3.1`
  - TypeScript `5.5.3`
  - Vite `5.4.2` (build tool)
  - Material UI (`@mui/material`, `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`) for UI components and theming.
  - Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS, configured to align with MUI theme).
  - `lucide-react` and `@mui/icons-material` for icons.
  - `react-router-dom` for routing.
  - `date-fns` for date utilities.
  - `react-error-boundary` for error handling.
  - ESLint for linting.
- **Last Working Version**: Not explicitly determinable from current information, but the application appears to be in a runnable, partially developed state.
- **Market Opportunity**: Provides valuable, consolidated, real-time information for a niche outdoor activity group, potentially improving safety and planning for recreational water sports enthusiasts in a specific geographic area.
