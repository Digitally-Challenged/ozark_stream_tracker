Adkins is one of those – 1.75 miles of blind boulder piles that'll test whether you've got the skills or just the gear.\n\nThe creek opens with three blind ledges they call \"Gimme Three Steps,\" and if you're smart you'll heed that Skynyrd warning. Then comes \"The Last Step\" – a big drop into an undercut grotto that earned its name the hard way. Downstream you'll find \"Ghost's Hole\" and \"Dead Man's Leap,\" neither of which got called that for being friendly.\n\nAfter Adkins dumps you out, you've still got 13 miles of floodstage Hailstone Creek to navigate. This is wilderness paddling where the only thing continuous is the commitment. You'll need expert-level skills and local knowledge, or you'll be providing both to the next group through.",

First mile's called \"Jungle Gym\" and there's a nasty hole 30 yards from the put-in, just so you know what you're in for.\n\nYou'll find Beech Ball, a class IV that lives up to its name.

The line goes main channel left through a slot, over a ledge, down a narrow slide, then cuts 90 degrees right to a big slide. Thread it clean or don't thread it at all.\n\nSomewhere in here there's a house-sized slab rock that's at least 50% undercut. They call it \"The Undercut\" because sometimes the obvious name is the right one. Avoid it.\n\nFinal two miles down Buck Branch give you many class III drops and several play spots to catch your breath.

Limestone cliffs worn smooth by time, sink holes opening up in the earth, springs pouring cold water from the rock. There are caves back in the hollows and waterfalls tumbling down after good rain. The rock formations here tell stories if you know how to listen.\n\nAs you drift downstream, the river spreads out and settles down. Middle sections run Class I-II, more forgiving water. By the time you reach the lower stretches near Buffalo City, it's mostly flatwater – wider pools, gentle current, the kind of paddling where you can put your oar across the gunwales and just watch the canyon walls slide by.\n\nYou'll find your run depending on what you're after.

Almost no eddies. Constant class IV intensity with class V interruptions. You start with The Test at class IV, proving you belong here. Then Rooster Poot, also class IV. Then Dumb and Dumber earns its V rating proper.\n\nAfter that comes Whack-A-Yaker, followed by The Drop Zone - two hundred yards of class V staircase that'll make you understand why this creek carries a 9895 TDCR. That's one of the hardest ratings in the state.

Named rapids on S2 include Football Field Rapids (a 100-yard long series of ledges), El Horrendo, Surfing Ledges, and Buck-N-Flush (once an infamous stopper hole).\n\nWhat makes Lee matter beyond its own paddling is the gauge. When you're wondering if Blackburn's running, if Clear Creek's up, if Ben Doodle's worth the drive - you check Lee Creek. The gauge at Highway 220 tells the story for half the creeks in Crawford County. That's where Blackburn comes in too, where Section 2 starts.\n\nThe creek's friendly at normal levels. When it climbs past ten feet, a hydraulic forms where Hart Creek feeds in - locals call it the \"Hole-o-death,\" which is darkly practical naming.

The gradient tells the story: 285 feet per mile overall, but the last 0.4 miles on Long Branch drops at 450 feet per mile. The last half mile of the creek is essentially one long steep complex rapid.\n\nNamed drops include Duck and Cover, Baby Zwick's, and Switchback. The full run covers 2 miles on Long Branch plus 4.5 miles on EFLB.\n\nThis isn't a creek you stumble onto - it's the kind of tributary you seek out after you've earned the right to paddle it, after you've swum enough easier water to know what serious consequences look like. Expert runs tend to document themselves in stories told around campfires, not in guidebooks. You find Long Branch by knowing someone who knows someone, and you run it because you've proven you can handle what it's offering.",

    "description": "Near Richland Creek, Long Devils Fork meets up with Big Devils Fork to form Twin Falls, and you'll want to pay attention here. Long Devils Fork features one of the longest rock slides in Arkansas - expect to reach terminal velocity if there's sufficient water.\n\nThe centerpiece is a 16 to 18 foot waterfall at Twin Falls. Run it left of center and try to maintain good speed to launch well into the pool below. Several pitons have occurred due to low-speed runs - this is not a place to hesitate.\n\nOut of twenty-plus runs, folks have found only two or three clean lines down Long Devil's Falls. That tells you something about the kind of water you're dealing with. Depending on what the creek's giving you, you can run Big Devils Fork on the left or take a short carry to the Long Devils Fork side. Either way, you'll earn your supper. This is the kind of run where you scout more than you paddle, and there's no shame in that.",

November 14, 1993, eight kayakers put in at elevation 1840 and didn't take out until well after dark, hiking roads by flashlight to find their vehicles. These days folks call it Sandy Springs Hollow, after the small hollow at the put-in.\n\nThe gradient tells the story: 190 feet per mile average, with half a mile hitting 320. This is the extreme upper section of the East Fork Little Buffalo, and it rates right up there with the hardest hair runs in the Ozarks. Water levels fall fast on a watershed this tiny - put in early.\n\nThe creek starts with fast slides, then a class III ledge before boulders choke it into something much more serious. At lower water, pins are likely for the next half mile. At higher water, a downed tree becomes life-threatening at this gradient.\n\nThe highlight is Rooster's Two Step - named for the 3-foot step above a 12-foot waterfall, first run by David Bibbs (they called him \"The Rooster\"). The approach is a blind curve left with one potential eddy on the right. If you boat around that corner, hang on tight.\n\nAfter the Rooster, the gradient stays serious and the rocks get big and ugly. Bad sieves at low water mean mandatory portages. Higher water opens things up, but good luck slowing down - a flip here means a serious beating. When the main EFLB stem comes in from the right, you're not done - that creek will be big and brawny at these levels, possibly the wildest part of your day.\n\nIf there's any doubt, put in on the EFLB instead.",

The most dangerous rapid is Lower Screw Up, also called Shaw's Folly (IV), which features a badly undercut rock. Maytag (III) rounds out the named rapids. At higher levels, the water volume and steep gradient can create a very dangerous combination, making for a solid class IV-V run.\n\nSection 2 (10 miles) runs class II-III with a gentler 20 fpm gradient.

It sits just after a two-foot sloping ledge with a river-wide hydraulic. When you see that horizon line, you'll know you've arrived.\n\nSpirits Creek is highly recommended to those with the skills for non-stop rapids.
