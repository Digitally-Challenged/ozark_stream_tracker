Adkins is one of those – 1.75 miles of blind boulder piles that'll test whether you've got the skills or just the gear.\n\nThe creek opens with three blind ledges they call \"Gimme Three Steps,\" and if you're smart you'll heed that Skynyrd warning. Then comes \"The Last Step\" – a big drop into an undercut grotto that earned its name the hard way. Downstream you'll find \"Ghost's Hole\" and \"Dead Man's Leap,\" neither of which got called that for being friendly.\n\nAfter Adkins dumps you out, you've still got 13 miles of floodstage Hailstone Creek to navigate. This is wilderness paddling where the only thing continuous is the commitment. You'll need expert-level skills and local knowledge, or you'll be providing both to the next group through.",

First mile's called \"Jungle Gym\" and there's a nasty hole 30 yards from the put-in, just so you know what you're in for.\n\nYou'll find Beech Ball, a class IV that lives up to its name.

The line goes main channel left through a slot, over a ledge, down a narrow slide, then cuts 90 degrees right to a big slide. Thread it clean or don't thread it at all.\n\nSomewhere in here there's a house-sized slab rock that's at least 50% undercut.

Limestone cliffs worn smooth by time, sink holes opening up in the earth, springs pouring cold water from the rock. There are caves back in the hollows and waterfalls tumbling down after good rain. The rock formations here tell stories if you know how to listen.\n\nAs you drift downstream, the river spreads out and settles down. Middle sections run Class I-II, more forgiving water. By the time you reach the lower stretches near Buffalo City, it's mostly flatwater – wider pools, gentle current, the kind of paddling where you can put your oar across the gunwales and just watch the canyon walls slide by.\n\nYou'll find your run depending on what you're after.

The Ozarks have a way of hiding water like this in the folds of the hills, waiting for someone skilled enough to find it.",

The creek rises in the Boston Mountains right alongside Big Piney, the Hailstone, Kings River, Mulberry, and the Upper White - good company for a creek to start with. All that water heading different directions from the same high country, each one carving its own character into the stone.\n\nThose willows earn their reputation.

The name tells you what you'll be looking at - pale limestone showing through clear Ozark water, right up until the gradient kicks in and you're too busy to appreciate geology.\n\nAnother one where the details come from the people who've been there, not from guidebooks. Ask around at the takeout on other creeks and eventually you'll find someone who knows.",

    "description": "Over near Wister in eastern Oklahoma, there's a wave that sets up when the conditions come together right. Probably tied to dam releases or the river's mood, the kind of feature that brings out the playboaters when word spreads that it's on.\n\nDifferent game than the downriver runs, but river features don't care what state they're in or what kind of kayaking you prefer. Water makes waves, and waves make smiles.",
