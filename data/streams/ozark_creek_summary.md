THE INFORMATION PRESENTED HERE IS IN NO WAY GUARANTEED TO BE ACCURATE OR UP-TO-DATE. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY WHEN YOU BOAT THESE OR ANY OTHER CREEKS.

INTRODUCTION AND RATING INFORMATION

This document contains information on the whitewater rivers and creeks of
Arkansas. The information is NOT guaranteed to be completely accurate or
up-to-date. Rapids, hazards, and access status may change quickly for many
of these creeks. All ratings and descriptions are solely the opinion
of the author, and the reader assumes all responsibility for his or her own
interpretation of the material presented here. When you choose to paddle
any creek, you do so at your own risk! Don't substitute these
ratings and descriptions for scouting and good judgement.

To help put the ratings in perspective here are some sample ratings of rivers
in other parts of the country that I have done:

    Nantahala R. (NC)                                   = II-III
    Chattooga R. (GA) Sect III @ 2.5 ft.                = II-IV
    Ocoee R. (TN) @ 1200 cfs                            = III
    Tellico R. (Ledges) (TN) @ 500 cfs                  = III-IV
    Crystal Narrows (CO) @ 1200 cfs                     = IV
    Pine Cr. and Numbers, Arkansas R. (CO) @ 1200 cfs   = III-IV (V)
    Chattooga R. Sect IV @ 2.5 ft. (high)               = III-V
    Upper Gauley R. @ 2800 cfs                          = III-V
    Cascades of the Nantahala @ optimal flows           = III-IV+
    Russell Fork (KY) @ 800 cfs                         = IV-V

These may seem a bit low to you if you're a beginner, or they may seem a
bit high to you if you're a seasoned expert. And, of course, some of these
runs, such as creek runs like the Cascades and Tellico, compare better
with Ozark streams than bigger river runs like the Chattooga and Gauley.
Just remember that a class III rating in this document generally means that
you can expect a lot of solid class III action. If the rating is class IV
or V there will be oppourtinites for serious injury or even death for
an out of control paddler.

The Index by Difficulty section (below) provides a fairly good comparison
of the overall difficulty of the creeks. Creeks of equal or very similar
difficulty have been listed in alphabetical order. Also notice that some
creeks that have similar ratings have very different hazards (Cossatot R.
and Fall Cr. for instance). On the lower end of the scale, don't assume
that just because you have successfully run the Big Piney and Hurricane
creeks, you are ready to tackle creeks such as Spirits Cr. and Kings R.
The gap between class II to II+ and class III to III+ is a big one. Take
time to hone your skills on the runs you are comfortable with before
moving on to the next level. Above the class III level, the creeks become
very tight and technical, and very fast paced (with Richland Cr. being a
relatively big, medium volume entry in the class IV category). The margin
for error on these creeks is often very small, and the penalties for
mistakes can be very high. Runs at the top of the scale such as Whistlepost Cr.,
Beech Cr., Shop Cr., Sulphur Cr., and Possum Walk Cr. represent the limit of
navigable water in the Ozarks. These runs have already produced injuries,
accidents and several near misses, despite only having been run a few times
each. Even boaters who routinely run these types of creeks put themselves
at great risk when attempting these runs. Please don't try to establish your
reputation by running these dangerous steep creeks. These runs can
put a permanent end to your whitewater career.

The rapidly changing water levels on many of the Ozark creeks can greatly
influence the difficulty and danger of a run. On many of the small, steep
creeks, an optimal run is had at less than 300 cfs. A little more water
can turn a fun class III run into a class V death trap. Many creeks are
also choked with fallen trees and willow strainers. These hazards are
unpredictable, and they can form overnight. A badly placed strainer can
turn a class II rapid into a portage-or-die situation. Higher water levels
increase the current's speed and force and make strainers a much greater
hazard. Be aware of the dangers of flood stage paddling, and don't hesitate
to opt for a safer run or no run at all when the water is high.

Many of the rivers and creeks described in this document (as well as many
others) can be found in Tom Kennon's excellent guidebook Ozark Whitewater
(Menasha Ridge Press). This is a great resource
for Ozark paddlers of all levels, and no paddler should be without it.

This list is devoted primarily to the more challenging Ozark whitewater
streams. A good source of information on less difficult whitewater
rivers can be found in the Arkansas Floaters Kit Page maintained by the Arkansas Parks and Tourism
Department. Another good source is the GORP Arkansas Rivers Page at
http://www.gorp.com/gorp/resource/Us_river/ar.htm

LOCATING CREEKS

This document is divided into North and South Arkansas. The dividing line
between north and south is I-40, and most directions are relative to I-40.
When trying to locate put-ins and take-outs, USGS topographic quads (now
available in digital format from Delorme) and a book
called "The Arkansas Atlas and Gazetteer" may come in handy. Also, a book
named "The Roads of Arkansas" provides good non-topographic map coverage for
the entire state.

One final note concerning put-ins and take-outs. Many creeks in the
Ozarks are located on privately owned lands. Most landowners are very
reasonable about using their land for putting in or taking out as long as
you follow some simple guidelines:

1.  Always get permission BEFORE accessing a creek on private land. Failure
    to do this will certainly irritate even the most friendly landowners,
    and it will often result in the landowner denying access to everyone!
    If you can't find out who owns the land, find another creek to run, and
    come back for that one after you contact the owner. The long-term gain
    of avoiding trouble with the owner will far outweigh any short-term
    thrills. Also, be aware that anyone caught trespassing in Arkansas
    may face stiff fines, jail time, or, worse, the end of a shotgun
    barrel.
2.  Always treat the land with great respect. This applies to public
    as well as private lands. Don't litter, cut down trees, cut fences,
    or deface any property. Try to leave the land and the creek in better
    shape than you found it.
3.  Always treat the landowner with respect. Don't argue with an irate
    landowner. Try to calmly and politely explain your side, but respect
    his (or her) side as well. After all, he does own the land, and
    you are essentially in his backyard.
4.  Respect the landowner's privacy. Don't use obscene language, don't
    behave in an offensive way, and don't STRIP DOWN NAKED in view
    of a landowner or their house. You'd be surprised how much these
    actions can piss off someone who has small children.
5.  If a landowner denies you access to his land, please let other paddlers
    know about it. Spreading the word helps to ensure that there won't
    be more trespassers who might aggravate the situation further.

LIST FORMAT

The general format of each creek listing is as follows:

NAME of the creek or river
Rating: classification (I to VI) for the entire run
(A rating in parentheses such as III-IV (VI) indicates that
there is one rapid or section that is not characteristic of
the overall run.)
(A "\*" indicates that rating is an estimate or that the author
has not run the section in question.)
TDCR Rating: Rating (0 to 9) of four different factors. These
ratings should be used for comparison purposes only! 1) Technical Difficulty: how hard is it to run good lines
(avoiding major hazards)? 0 = easy, 9 = very hard 2) Danger Level: if you screw up (see #1 for how easy it
is to screw up) how high a price will you pay?
0 = very little risk, 9 = high risk of injury or death 3) Continuity of Rapids: how fast/continuous are the rapids?
0 = long pools, short rapids, 9 = almost no pools or
eddies. 4) Remoteness: if you screw up (#1) and get hurt (#2), how
far away is help? 0 = road right beside river,
9 = 3 day hike to somewhere that a helicopter
can land.
The rating is given as a four digit number like this: 6431.
This would indicate that a river is technically a 6,
danger level is 4, continuity is 3, and remoteness is 1.
These ratings are based on opinions collected from people
who have actually paddled the rivers in question. Some
runs are not rated because I couldn't get an opinion on them.
Warning: This system may not correspond to the international
system (I - VI).
Location: Counties and put-in and take-out locations (when available)
NOTE: Please read the section on Creek Access before
trying to access any creek.
Topo Quad(s): USGS topographic 7.5 minute (1:24000) series maps
Gradient: average in feet per mile
Length: length of the run in miles
Season: ALL = all year round, FALL = Fall, SPRING = Spring,
RAIN = only after local rains,
FLOOD = only after local flood
NOTE: If a run is of type RAIN, you may be able to
catch it one to three days after a heavy rain.
If a run is of type FLOOD, you probably
need to be there within hours of a heavy rain.
FLOOD runs are not easy to catch, unless you
live very near them, so don't drive in from
out-of-state expecting these to be running,
even during periods of wet weather.
Our season in Arkansas is generally from
October to May with the best months being
March to mid May.  
 Gauge: as much gauging info as is available
Hazards: rapids, strainers, and landowners that can threaten life
and limb

Index by Difficulty:
NOTE: This list is meant to be a rough guide to the relative difficulty of the streams. Each run has it's own mix of hazards and gradient, and the character of a run cannot adequately be summed up by a few roman numerals. So, don't rely on ratings or this list! Read the information on the creek, try to talk to others who have run the creek, hike down the creek to check it out before you run it, or do all of the above before you commit yourself to running any of the harder creeks on the list. Also, this list certainly doesn't indicate what the "hardest" or "best" runs are. Once the creeks get above the class III level THEY ARE ALL technical and dangerous and the primary factors deciding which one is the "most" difficult are water volume and the number and placement of tree strainers. These factors will be different each time the creeks are run.
The creeks are divided into five categories. Within each category they are listed in alphabetical order. The categories are somewhat subjective, but they are an attempt to match paddler skill level to the creeks in question. Here is a very rough idea of what each category means:

    1) Beginner: Has paddled less than five times on whitewater.  Has no
    	real paddling skills.  Comfortable only on class I and easy
    	class II.
    2) Novice: Has paddled several class II runs.  Has some boat control
    	skill, but unreliable self rescue skill.  Confident on class II
    	water and may run some class III.
    3) Intermediate: Has experience on many class II-III runs.  Has
    	good boat control in rapids, and has self rescue skills
    	(at least a pool roll).  Comfortable with most class III
    	rapids and may run some class IV.
    4) Advanced: Has experience on many class III-IV runs.  Has
    	excellent boat control in class III+ (including eddying and
    	ferrying), and solid self rescue skills (rolls in whitewater).
    	Confident in class III-IV water, and may run class V.  Can
    	lead continuous class III.
    5) Expert: Has years of experience on class III-V runs.  Has
    	excellent boat control even in very heavy water.  Has
    	bombproof self rescue skill, and can organize and exectute
    	rescue of others.  Confident in class IV-V water, and can
    	lead continuous class III-IV.

Of course, paddlers, like creeks, are not easy to lump into a finite number of categories. But this should provide you with a rough idea of what creeks you should be looking at.

North Arkansas
Adkins Cr.
Rating: III-V
TDCR: 7878
Location: Newton Co.; The put-in is reached by taking Dixon Ridge Rd.
west off of Hwy 21 about 1.5 miles north of Fallsville. This
road is the same as the put-in road for the popular Hailstone
Cr. run. About 2.5 miles down this road, just before it
starts to really drop in elevation down to the Hailstone,
there is a small road turning to the right in the middle of
a switchback. This road leads to the Dahl Memorial wilderness
access. You should see a USFS sign-in board located near a
parking turnout. Park here and brushwhack southeast about 1/2
mile to the creek. You're aiming for approx. elevation 1820
feet, where two major tributaries merge. The take-out is at
the Hwy. 21 bridge over the Buffalo R., the standard Hailstone
take-out. In an emergency (such as not having time to
paddle out on the Hailstone), you can pull out at the confluence
with the Hailstone and brushwhack up 500 vertical feet to
a small road that will take you back to the put-in. This
is not a fun thing to do, but if you have to do it, start at the
confluence on the left side of Adkins and try to follow the
spine of the ridge up to the southwest. Always keep climbing
because the point you're trying to reach is at the very top
(elevation 2087 on the USGS Fallsville quad). The foundation
of an old homestead marks the end of the road which leads off
to the southwest and eventually ends up at the Dahl Memorial.  
 It's best to take along a good topo map and compass. Good luck.
Topo Quad(s): Fallsville, Boxley
Gradient: 150 fpm (2nd mile at 190 fpm)
Length: 15 mi. (2 miles on Adkins plus 13 miles on Hailstone Cr.)
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Several feet of water over the low water bridge over the Buffalo R.
at Ponca is probably a good indicator. Smith Cr. should also
look very big and muddy at Hwy. 21. Like Smith Cr., putting
on shortly after very heavy rainfall is a must for catching
the creek at a good level. Dragging down to the put-in
when it's too low can be a nightmare. You may be able to
predict the levels using the Buffalo R. rain gauges which are
linked below. The Ponca and Buffalo Tower gauges are the ones
to watch.
LINK BUFFALO NATIONAL R. GAUGES (UPDATED HOURLY)
Hazards: strainers, severely undercut rocks, severe rapids, hydraulics,
etc.
Description: Overlooked and ignored for many years, Adkins Cr. was first
paddled on June 17, 2000 by Dave "Ghost" Reid, Steve "Dog"
Robertson, and Bill "Fish" Herring. Like many Newton Co. creek
runs, a run down Adkins creek can't be adequately summed up
in print. It compares in difficulty to classics like Beech Cr.
and Shop Cr., but like those has a personality all it's own.  
 Probably the best way to get an appreciation for the creek is
to hike it from the put-in to the Buffalo and back up. The
hike is spectacular and will give you a chance to inspect
the big rocks that form the myriad drops in the creek. When
big rains fall, the creek becomes runnable where two smaller
creeks merge southeast of the Dahl Memorial. Immediately the
paddler is faced with three blind ledges. This is "Gimme Three
Steps", and it is a great start to the day if you avoid getting
surfed in the holes at the bottom of the drops. After some
tree dodging you'll come around a corner and onto a sliding
shelf of rock. Get out quickly to scout "The Last Step". This
big drop is walled in by an undercut grotto, and at moderate to
high levels the water below kicks underneath the river right
wall making for a class V drop. It was not run on the
firost descent, but it may look more user friendly at lower or
higher water levels. Until the hydraulic is probed, it should
be treated as a keeper. Portage is easiest on the right side.
A big slide into a hole follows Last Step, and after this the
creek changes to blind, undercut boulder piles for the next
1.75 miles. The first of these, "Undercut #1" will give you an
idea of what is going to come at you over and over again for the
rest for the trip. There are two particulary nasty spots to
watch out for. One of these is "Ghost's Hole" about 1/8 mile
below Last Step. After dropping over a few ledges the creek
runs underneath an undercut bluff on the left. A pour on the
right can be run, but a mistake may still put you under the wall.  
 The only good portage option is on the right. The second major
hazard is another nasty undercut trap located maybe 1/4 mile
from the end of the gorge. "Dead Man's Leap" looks just like
many of the other ledge/boulder drops from the top, but all
of the water pours off of the ledge and under a big rock. The
creek is walled in by bluffs and portages are tricky. Although
these are the only drops I'll single out, at moderately high
levels almost every drop is potentially dangerous. Frequent
bank scouting is a must, and moves in front of undercuts are
a fact of life. The average drop involves running a class III+
line to miss class V hazards. For the experienced creeker it
is Nirvana. For anyone not familiar with this type of water
it will not be pleasant. Once you emerge at the confluence
with the Hailstone, you have two options. The best one is to
paddle out, but the Hailstone will be at or near flood, and it
is a continuous, hairy, big-water run at these levels. Huge
keeper holes and pourovers must be carefully avoided. If you
have the time to make it before dark, you can paddle to Hwy. 21 in
around 2.5 to 3 hours. If not, take-out option #2 is a 500
vertical foot climb back up to a small road that follows the top
of the ridge for two miles back to the Dahl Memorial. This is
only a last resort, but it may be less dangerous than trying to
boat flooded rapids in the dark. Adkins is an incredible
wilderness creek run combined with a long, floodstage run-out on
the Hailstone. Trips can quickly become epic and aborting a trip
anywhere in the gorge is about the least fun thing I can think
of. Make sure you're comfortable running this type of steep
creek before you commit yourself to this awesome Ozark gorge.

Archey Cr. (A.K.A. Archey's Fork of Little Red)
Rating: II+
TDCR: ????
Location: Pope and Van Buren Co.; Take Hwy. 16 west from Clinton
and then Hwy. 264 north to the bridge over the creek. Put
in at this bridge. Take out at the Hwy. 65 bridge in Clinton.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Alread, Botkinburg, Old Lexington, Clinton
Gradient: ??? fpm
Length: 20 mi
Season: RAIN
Gauge: none. The Big Piney gauge is a reasonable estimate. The
Piney should be between 4 and 7 feet for a good run.
Hazards: numerous strainers
Description: This is a long but fun run, and it makes a good overnight
trip, if you secure permission for camping on private land.
Other put-ins are possible, but be sure you get permission
to cross private lands to get to the river. The run has
many class II+ rapids, and the whitewater is fairly
continuous much of the way. Willow strainers can be
a major hazard, however, so stay on your toes. This is
a good run for paddlers comfortable on class II-III water.

Bear Creek (Middle Big Piney Tributary)
Rating: III-V _
TDCR: ????
Location: Go 4 miles West on Hwy 123 from Pelsor (Sand Gap) and take
Forest Service Road 1802 South at Bertha. The road runs the
ridge on the West Side of Indian Creek. Drive about 1.3
miles and look for a deer camp on the left. Park at the
camp and carry down the trail directly across the road. The
trail immediately passes by a small pond. Follow the trail
North to the end of the knob and follow the trail 3/4 down
the mountain. The trail continues North and crosses a small
creek. Bushwhack to the left on the North side of the creek
to the main creek. This is where the 3 upper forks come
together at the beginning of a long slide. (Elevation 1490)
Reach the take-out by going East from the Hwy 123 bridge
over the Piney for 1/4 mile. The Hwy crosses over Sugar
Creek in a right hand turn then curves left up the hill.
Look for the first road to the left (South). Another deer
camp is located here. A 4WD trail leads 1/4 mile to the
creek just above the confluence with the Big Piney.
(Elevation 720)
Topo Quad(s): Fort Douglas
Gradient: 185 fpm
Length: 4 mi
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Gage at Richland Campground should to be above 6 or headed
that way. Look for 1.5" or more rain at the Deer and Ben
Hur rain gages, at the BNR Data Page. Rain must have fallen
within the last 6 to 12 hours. If the Sugar Creek just East
of the Hwy 123 bridge over the Piney is flowing good, it's
a definite run!
Hazards: Undercut ledges and rocks, overhanging branches,
strainers, waterfalls. Very tight in places (pinning
hazards). Don't broach in "Mama Bear Falls" and beware of
"Papa Bear Falls". The "Bear Trap" is a nasty undercut 3/4
of the way down the creek after section of class II water.
The first 1.25 miles drops at 300 ft/mile.
Description: First known descent was December 12, 1999 by Lance Jones,
Cowper Chadbourn, Greg Churan, Shelby Johnson, Mitchell
Ford, Graham Henry and Jeff Riley. The creek starts out fast
and narrow with a 50-60 yard long stair stepping slide
ending in a steep funnel dropping 10-12 feet. The creek is
very narrow as is starts to cut into the gorge, several
long slides and boulder fields are encountered in the
first 1/2 miles. At this point be on the lookout for a
small creek crashing in on the left. Immediately below the
confluence is the "Bear Pin". A cluttered approach makes
the left side boof difficult. A vertical pin is very
likely with a missed boof. A few hundred yards downstream
the creek turns 90 degrees to the left as a small
tributary enters on the right. Get out on the river left
and portage the inside of the corner around the multiple
logjams. This is the end of the warm-up. The creek drops
200 feet in the next 2/3 mile! Maximum gradient tops out
over 550 ft/mile in this section. After a couple of nice
drops the creek sweeps to the right and cuts back to the
left around a steep right bank. Eddy out and scout the
next boulder jumble, "Bear Claw". There are multiple
routes through the jumble and pinning is very possible.
Low water runs through here are tight and bumpy. Only a
couple smaller drops separate the end of "Bear Claw" and
the entrance slide to "Baby Bear Falls". This is a very
clean and very beautiful 15+ drop. A gentle slide
transitions into a 45 degree slope then empties into a
fantastic grotto pool over a 8-10 ft waterfall. Enjoy the
view and be ready to scout the next big drop less than 100
yards downstream. "Mama Bear Falls" starts with a 20 yard
gentle slide 20 feet wide then drops 15+ feet at a very
steep angle as it funnels into a 4 foot wide notch. After
leaving the notch the water fans out over bedrock as it
pushes toward the left overhanging wall. Eddy out above
the next horizon line. Scout and/or portage on the left
for the big boy, "Papa Bear Falls". The creek splits into
two narrow slots around a large boulder in the middle of
the 15-foot wide creek. The water drops 12+ feet from each
slot into a 8-10 ft wide cauldron. The exit from the
cauldron is through a 3-5 ft wide 15 ft deep sluice that
is 50-60 feet long and makes a jog to the left in the
middle. The sluice looked nasty at the low water level, a
flip or pin in there will be disastrous. The water exits
the sluice over a 10 foot drop out of a wall into another
picture perfect grotto pool. This was the only drop not
run on the first descent. This is truly a unique drop. The
creek calms down a little for half-mile before entering a
mini gorge recognized by the return of large boulders to
the creek. Pick you way through the slots. The creek
returns to calm fast class II, but don't get lulled just
yet. A small tributary will enter on the left as the creek
takes a hard right turn. Again boulders reappear in the
creek. After a slot to the left cuts back to the right
along a steep shale bank, look for a very large boulder on
the left followed by another very large on the right bank.
Cut to the left immediately behind the first boulder and
scrape down the boat-wide channel. The main channel stays
to the right toward and UNDER the second Boulder. It is
very difficult to recognize until you are right on it or
know it is there. This one is apply named "Bear Trap".
Fast class II water takes you the last mile to just above
the confluence with the Piney. Look for the 4WD trail on
the right just as a field comes into view. Like other
micro-volume creeks, meaningful ratings are difficult to
establish on the accepted International scale. At lower
levels, the creek will seem like a very technical Class
III, with much rock bashing, scraping, and some portages.
At higher levels, several rapids are expected to become
solid Class V. A tip o' the hat to Lance Jones for a
write-up of this great Ozark steepie!

Beech Cr.
Rating: III-V
TDCR: 8888
Location: Newton Co.; Put in is off of Cave Mtn. Rd. west of Boxley.
You must hike down to Edgemon Cr. from near Ryker just past
the Whitaker Point (Hawksbill Crag) trail head. GET
PERMISSION FROM LOCAL LANDOWNERS BEFORE TRESPASSING ON
PRIVATE LANDS. Take out is at the Beech Cr. bridge at
Hwy 21 at Boxley. You should park at the Boxley bridge over
the Buffalo R., since there is no room to park at the
Beech Cr. bridge.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Boxley
Gradient: 90 fpm (some sections approach 120 fpm)
Length: 7.5 mi
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: The Buffalo R. should usually be running very high - over two
feet of water over the low water bridge at Ponca is a good sign.
There is a gauge painted on the river-right side of a pylon
on the Beech Cr. bridge at Hwy 21. A minimum put-in level would
be around 4 feet and rising. If the creek is already falling
look for at least 5 feet on this gauge. The creek drops out very
quickly (forming many boulder sieves at low water), so plan
for that. The creek has been run at levels over 7 feet on
this gauge, but at really high levels the creek is incredibly
pushy with several near-terminal holes. You may be able to
predict the levels using the Buffalo R. rain gauges which are
linked below. The Ponca and Buffalo Tower gauges are the ones
to watch.
LINK BUFFALO NATIONAL R. GAUGES (UPDATED HOURLY)
Hazards: continuous tough rapids, strainers, undercuts, etc., etc.
Description: Beech is quite possibly the toughest overall run in
the Ozarks. The first runs/walks of Beech may have occurred in
the early 80's but the first complete run of the creek was
probably done by a small group including Jeff Green in the Fall
of 1986. The rapids are long, continuous, and demanding and the
penalties for mistakes are usually severe. The creek runs through
an almost inaccessible gorge, so hiking out is very unpleasant,
though more than a few boaters have done so. Pins and swims are
not uncommon events, even among boaters who know the creek well,
and equipment can easily be broken or lost if a mishap occurs.
The drops are non-stop, with one drop feeding right into the
next for more than five miles. Multiple slot drops abound,
and paddlers unfamiliar with the creek will need to take
plenty of time to scout to avoid the many dead-end slots and
other hidden traps. A few drops do stand out of the crowd.
The first mile is known as the Jungle Gym, which starts with
a nasty hole just 30 yards from the put-in, and provides
only small eddies to stop in from there. Just before the
confluence of Edgemon Cr. and upper Beech Cr. (or Beech
"Proper" as it has come to be known), Beech Ball is a class
IV drop with a tough move to miss the "Ball" at the end.
At the confluence with Beech Proper, would-be hair
boaters can hike up to look at a series of class IV+ drops
just upstream on the merging creek - if time permits.
About 150 yards from the confluence is White Lightning,
a long slide with huge waves and a big hole at the end!
The last drop that really stands out is Beech Falls, a nasty
looking class IV ledge with a reasonable line just to the
right of the rock splitting the drop at its lip. It's best to
run angling hard left after you come around the rock, since the
rooster tail on the right tends to knock the ever lovin crap
out of paddlers who hit it (to quote creek pioneer Jeff Green).
Of course, this description of the "highlights" omits dozens
of other long, technical drops, some with thin lines around
dangerous hazards. Beech Cr. basically throws everything in
the book at you for five miles in a row, wearing paddlers
down and making it arguably the most difficult overall run
in the Midwest. Several of the area's best creek boaters have
come away from the creek with damaged egos, equipment, and
bodies! Regardless of your skill level, the best way to
tackle Beech is to run it behind someone who has been there
before. The creek is a BIG step up from creeks like Richland,
EFLB, etc. Make sure you're ready for it and take your creek
boat with you for this one. Thanks go to Ryan Johnson and Shelby
Johnson for information on this legendary Ozark creek!

Ben Doodle Cr.
Rating: IV-V
TDCR: 9895
Location: The take-out is at the popular Hwy 220 bridge over Lee Cr.
(the put-in for section 2 of Lee). To get to the put-in
take Hwy 220 south from Lee Cr. (the paved side) until you
almost reach the top of the hill. Turn off on the first
major dirt road to the left. This is the road that goes
from Hwy. 220 to Chester and Hwy. 71. Follow this road for
approx. 5 miles until you reach a four-way intersection
(there is a house with a large cedar fence at the
intersection). Take a left (a 120 degree switchback) and
drive about 2 miles. You'll eventually see a private RV
hookup on the right. Just past this RV hookup, a road turns
left and immediately forks in two directions. (If you get to
a small chruch and cemetery on the left you've gone too far.)
Take the right fork down the hill if you have a 4WD or park
at the camping spot on the left fork and hike down 1/8 mile
to the creek. The first tiny creek that the road crosses is
Ben Doodle Cr.
Topo Quad(s): Rudy NE
Gradient: 350 fpm (1/2 mi @ 550 fpm)
Length: 7.5 mi (counting 5.75 miles on Blackburn Cr. and Lee Cr.)
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: The best way to gauge it is to inspect the put-in. Water
should be filling the streambed and the creek should look
easily boatable where the road crosses it. The big
slide just downstream of the road should be able to be
run without slowing the boat down much on the way down.
Keep in mind that the water you see at the put-in is
basically all of the water you have in the gorge. If
Lee Cr. is at 15+ feet and Clear Cr. at Chester is in
flood you MIGHT have enough water to run Ben Doodle.
Ben Doodle has a much smaller watershed than Hart Cr.,
and it takes a very heavy rain (2.5+ inches) in a very
short time to bring it up.
Hazards: waterfalls, undercut rocks, trees, barbed wire (at the
first rapid), and continous, heavy rapids
Description: Ben Doodle Cr. may be the fastest and most difficult
creek run in Crawford Co. It's certainly the steepest run I
I know of that you can drive to! This tiny creek was first run
at very low levels on April, 5 1999 by Steve "Dog" Robertson,
Zack Smith, Rob Pollan, Mike Echols, and Bill Herring. Quite a
few rapids were not run on the first descent due to the water
level, and those that were run were not at full speed -
much of the creek was shallow class III+ water at the first
descent level. It was attempted again about two years later at
a very high level by Mikle and Rob, but that time high water
made several rapids extremely hazardous. As a result, there
are several rapids in the gorge that have yet to be run.
This tiny creek needs a lot of rainfall to reach runnable
levels, and once it gets there, it doesn't stay there
long. When you get to the put-in, don't put on the creek
at the road crossing. A barbed wire fence hangs into
the creek just around the corner. Carry your boat down 30
yards or so and put in just past the fences if you want
to run the 18+ foot "Doodle Slide" to start off
the run. Be careful to not get washed downstream at
the bottom the the slide because another barbed wire
strand hangs at the lip of the next small fall that
immediately follows the slide. Portage from the base of
Doodle Slide around this next fence. After this portage,
the creek drops over back-to-back class III+ drops
through trees. This is the warmup stretch for the gorge, so
if you have trouble here, it's a good idea to hike out
before you reach the more intense rapids below. About
1/4 mile down you'll run into a brutal drop of twelve feet
nicknamed "The Midget Maker". This rapid has a completely
blind approach - by the time you see the horizon line you
are committed to the drop. There is however a good eddy
that can be used to stop and portage the drop just
above it. Scout ahead dilligently until you get past
this drop! The drop lands on solid rock - a probe
boat dropped over on the first run slammed into the
streambed only one foot under the surface! Portage
Midget Maker on the right. You're now in the gorge and the
intensity just keeps increasing from here down. After
another 100 yards of complex drops, you'll stumble
into "Atom Smasher". Scout ahead at every turn
after Midget Maker to keep from being swept into this huge
drop against your will. This rapid starts as an simple
rock jumble, goes around a corner, drops through some
large twisting drops and then finishes with a big slide.
The total vertical drop between starting and stopping is
over 40 feet. If you come around the first innocent
looking corner, you'll probably be running the entire
rapid, so approach this one with care. Several complex
class III+ to IV drops follow Atom Smasher. There are few
places to stop, so when you do get stopped scout ahead to
the next pool or eddy. The gradient in this stretch
approaches pegs out at over 500 fpm. When you see a
house-sized rock on the left ahead of you, get out to portage
a large deadfall just around the corner. Take this oppoutunity
to scout the next 150 yards. Somewhere in that distance the
creek goes from moderately crazy to completely insane as
it enters the 700+ fpm gradient around Tenderizer and
Masticator. Where Tenderizer actually begins is debatable
It is simply the name for the multiple class IV to IV+
drops that proceed the 18 foot class V drop of Masticator.
Scout this stretch very carefully, as there are many hidden
hazards. If you decide to run it, set plenty of bank support
in strategic places along the way. A blown line here could
result in serious problems. If you make the decision to
portage Masticator, either bank will work well. After
Masticator, you'll get 1/3 mile of more class III to IV drops.
This is not as intense as the section just above, but don't
let your gaurd down too quickly. After that, the creek mellows
to continous class II-III with lots of trees until it
merges into a flooded Blackburn Cr. At these extremely
high levels Blackburn and Lee Cr. can present some serious
hazards as well. Don't play around with these creeks at
these levels. After you merge with Lee Cr. watch for Hart
Cr. to come in on the left. When it does, get to the far
left side of the creek to skirt a huge, deadly hydraulic
that forms across Lee Cr. just below the Hart Cr. confluence.
At floodstage, the 6 mile trip down Blackburn and Lee to
the Hwy. 220 bridge should only take 1.5 hours or so.
Dispite the rather silly name, Ben Doodle is a serious
Ozark creek run. As is typicall of Crawford Co. the rapids
are generally ugly boulder piles often with no really
good routes. The creek is tiny, but that actually works
against a paddler when there is sufficient water, providing
little or no maneuvering room. A pre-run hike is an
excellent idea, but nothing will eliminate the need for
almost continuous bank scouting in the gorge. As a result
it's a good idea to plan on taking three to four hours
to navigate the half mile long gorge. Ben Doodle is a
big step up from its sister creek, Hart Cr. If there is any
doubt, run Hart Cr., which features class III+ to IV+
rapids in a less threatening environment. Both of these are
no place for those who are not absolutely confident of
their abilities on fast, tight Ozark creeks and class IV+
water.

Big Devils Fork Cr.
Rating: III-V _
TDCR: 8786
Location: Newton Co.; Go south, downhill from Iceledo Gap to Hill
Cemetery (4WD required). Drag downhill about 0.1 mile to
put-in. Creek looks too small at put in, but do it anyway.
Take-out is at Richland Creek Campground.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Moore
Gradient: 190 fpm (not counting Richland)
Length: 2.4 mi. plus 1.5 mi. on Richland
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Water should be nearly flush with Richland Campground bridge
or above 6 ft on the ACC Bulletin Board gauge. Also, look for
1.5" or more rain at the Deer and Ben Hur rain gauges, as
posted on the ACC Bulletin Board. Rain must have fallen
within the last 6 to 12 hours for a run. At very high levels,
expect a solid class V run for 4 miles.
Hazards: severe undercuts, difficult rapids, overhanging branches,
strainers, waterfalls
Description: First known descent of this creek was on April 11, 1995
by Cowper Chadbourn, Charles Chevallier, Andy Hicks, Nathan
Kline, and Joe Warren (of Galveston), with the exception of
Big Devil's Fall (one of the Twin Falls) which was first run
by Nathan Kline on April 29, 1995. This run begins as a
creek so tiny that you will think you have made a mistake,
but it quickly builds in intensity. The run has many tough
class III to IV rapids sprinkled with a generous helping of
strainers and undercut rocks. The highlight of the trip is
the run of the Twin Falls near the confluence with Richland Cr.
Depending on water level, you may either run the Big Devils
(left) side, or access and run the the Long Devils side via a
short carry. As of December, 1995, of 20+ runs divided
between the Twin Falls, only two or three "pitons" have
occurred, all on Long Devil's Falls (river right). Keep your
speed up and try to launch well into the pool, running either
of the falls slightly left of center. Be prepared for a "big
water" run through some of Richland's most difficult rapids
after the confluence (IV+ at these levels). All rapids have
been run, although the boulder jumble just below the first
waterfall has been marginal for water levels encountered to
date. Big Devils Fork, like its sister creek, is an "experts
only" run. The extremely tight course, high gradient, and
numerous hazards combine to pose a significant risk of life
and limb for even the most experienced boaters. Thanks go
to Cowper Chadbourn for information on this great Ozark hair
run.

Big Piney Cr.
Rating: II
TDCR: 2224
Location: Johnson and Pope Co.;
S1: Take Hwy 7 north from I-40 at Russelville, and then take
Hwy 123 west to Fort Douglas. Put in at Hwy 123
bridge. Take out at Helton's Farm reached by taking
Hwy 164 west from Hwy 7 then NFR 1801 to NFR 1805
and heading west toward the river.
S2: Take out at Long Pool Rec. Area west of NFR 1801 on
NFR 1804.
S3: Take out at Hwy 164 bridge. Kerry Moore at Moore
Outdoors located just south of the bridge provides
canoes and/or shuttles for the run.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Fort Douglas, Treat
Gradient: 10 - 20 fpm
Length: S1: 8 mi.
S2: 10 mi.
S3: 5 mi.
Season: SPRING and FALL
Gauge: Readings can be obtained by calling the Corps at
501-324-5150 or by calling Moore Outdoors. The level should
be between 2.8 and 5.0 ft. for good canoeing. Advanced boaters
can enjoy pushy big water up to 7.0 ft.
LINK TO USGS GAUGE
Hazards: pourover hydraulics at high levels, the Little Mother rock
Description: S1 is a good class I-II run for canoeists. Beware of
downed trees in this section. S2 is a great play run for
intermediate boaters and a challenging run for beginners.
Some of the best action on S2 comes 3/4 of the way down at
Surfing Rapid and The Mother. The left side of The Mother
is a tricky class II+ to III rapid at any level, and the
Little Mother, a midstream boulder, seems to attract canoes
like a magnet. Surfing rapid usually has a good wave and a
very forgiving wash out. Many Ozark boaters have cut their
teeth on this stretch. S3 is more tamed down, but at high
water it kicks up big waves at The Haystacks. Just below
Long Pool you can go left or right of an island. The right
is a rather tricky chute I call Plinko. Most beginners will
want to stay away from this rapid, especially at high water.

Blackburn Cr.
Rating: II-III
TDCR: 3335
Location: The put-in can be reached by driving down off of Hwy 74.
The only real "public" access is off of the Holt
Road Loop near Devils Den State Park. Take Hwy 74 west off
of I-540 until you are just about to drop down the hill
into the State Park. When you see a "steep grade"
truck warning sign take the dirt road on your left. This is
just past a gated road on the left, and it is before the
main access to the Holt Road (near the parking area). Past
this point the roads are 4WD only! Follow the dirt road
about 1 mile. Look for a road to turn left and go steeply
downhill toward the creek. Follow this road for about 1 to
1.5 miles until you reach the creek. The road is extremely
rough in wet weather, so you may want to stop and walk down
if it looks too bad. The take out is (unfortunately) at Lee
Cr. at the Hwy 220 bridge (the put in for section 2 of Lee
Cr.). It's best to shuttle back to I-540 and then down
through Chester, because Fall Cr. will probably block you
if you take the route through Devils Den and up Hwy 220!
You can also put in by carrying down off of I-540 where it
crosses one of the far upper tributaries if there is a lot
of water in the creek. This hasn't been done yet, as far as
I know, but it is possible and will add quite a bit of
class II-III water onto the run.
Topo Quad(s): ???
Gradient: 25 fpm
Length: 8 mi.
Season: RAIN
Gauge: Lee Cr. should be above 6.5 or so for a possible Blackburn
run. If Lee is above 7.5 and assuming an even distribution
of rainfall in the watershed, Blackburn will have plenty of
water. Be careful that all of the water in Lee isn't
comming from Fall Cr. and Upper Lee Cr. (i.e. Devils Den
Park), which can happen. If Lee Cr. is over 10 feet expect
a much more serious ride down Blackburn. At over 15 feet on
the Lee Cr. gauge, strainers make much of the creek a death
trap, and other good area creeks are just hitting their
prime. A flood run on Blackburn would just be a dangerous
waste of time.
Hazards: Strainers and downed trees are the main hazard. There are a
few good hydraulics to look out for too though.
Description: Blackburn Cr. is a great class II+ wilderness run that has
been overlooked for years. The creek was probably first
run in the mid 80's, but very few boaters have ever done
it. The biggest problem is finding a put-in. When I-540
first opened, one of the comments I heard the most from
boaters was that it crossed Blackburn Cr. tributaries
several times and would provide a potential public access
to the creek. While I still don't know anyone who has
tried this, it is a very real possibility. Asuuming you
can find a good way to get to the creek, you'll have a
bouncy run through several miles of wild country. There
are plenty of strainers along the way and lots of fast
curves and swift rapids. Other than the trees, there are
no really serious hazards for competent class II-III
boaters. If the water is high (e.g. Lee Cr. is over 10 to
12 feet), watch out for some dangerous hydraulics,
especially an almost river-wide "hole-o-death"
that forms just past the Hart Cr. confluence on Lee Cr. At
high levels, Blackburn becomes pushy enough to elevate
some rapids into the class III category, but the strainers
become nearly unavoidable. It's probably a good idea to
find another run when the creek is running full tilt. At
any level, all boaters should be experienced with fast
class II-III water and dodging strainers.

Bobtail Cr.
Rating: III-IV+
TDCR: 7776
Location: Searcy Co.; Go south from Richland Campground 3.6 miles
on FS 1205, then east (left) 2.0 miles on FS 1219, and
finally north (another left) 3.0 miles on FS 1219A. From
this point turn east on a barely visible 4WD road that
descends a hill. If conditions are bad you may have to
carry the 0.7 mile down to the creek on this road.
Take out is on S2 of Richland Cr. Optional takeout is to
carry approx. 1.0 miles along trail back up to the Richland
Campground bridge.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Moore
Gradient: 125 fpm (1 mi @ 165 fpm)
Length: 2.5 mi. (+ 9.5 mi on S2 of Richland Cr.)
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Richland Cr. Campground bridge should have above 1 ft. of
airspace (About 4.0 ft or higher on the USGS web gauge).  
 Recent heavy local rains are a must for this run.
Look for Falling Water Falls to be runnable all the way
across. This is a good indication of water on Bobtail. Look
for 1.5 inches or more of rain in the last 12 hours on
the Tilly and Ben Hur rain gauges on the BNR site.
Hazards: undercuts, hydraulics, difficult rapids, and, of course, strainers
Description: This one was first run in Jan, 1994, by Cowper Chadbourn,
Jim McDaniel, and Paul Newton. It contains about ten very
significant rapids and lots of class III action in between.
For the first 0.75 miles, the creek is shallow fast class II-III with
willows. Good place to warm up, this section is also prone to downed
trees. Be on the lookout for a sweeping bend to the left terminating in a
log jam. Sometimes the logs can be jumped, many times a portage on the
left is needed. Immediately below this jam is the first set of good drops.
First 'Zorro' starts with a tight slot back to the left behind a pin rock.
Cut back to the right after the slot, avoid the undercut on the right and
line up for the wave/hole train that follows. Snake through the
rock gardens below with a 4-foot double ledge in the middle. A
large boulder rising vertically from the right signifies time to
eddy left. The next drop is 'Go Left Falls' aka 'Cowper Dam'. Most
of the water flows off a rock slanted to the right and into a narrow slot and
undercut. Get up plenty of speed and go off the end of the flat rock.  
 Several encounters with the slot have produced bruised bodies and egos. Next
is 'Coliseum' originally known as 'Go Right Falls' due to a tree in the left
slot on the first runs. Main channel goes right and over a 6-foot
stairstep. Alternate route is to run the slots on the left and boof into
the eddy. Take the straight line in the runout through a 3 foot wide slot.
Now the pre-show is over and you get brief intermission of more fast class
II-III water as Little Bobtail and Short Bobtail enter to pump up the
volume. When the creek cuts back to the left over a horizon line, you're
ready for the feature presentation. The next 0.75 miles is Ozark steep
creekin' at its best. Major rapids are 'Bail-Baby-Bail', 'Werewolf', 'The
Funnel' and 'The Slot'. 'Bail-Baby-Bail' starts at the horizon line and is
a long drop with undercuts, trees, holes and pin potential. Main line is
to enter down the slide right, avoid the rooster tail rock and tree, over
the ledge, around the corner to the right and down through the series of
holes to the left. The holes tend to push hard to the right and into the
shallow rocks on the bottom right side. Finish through some tight slots
after the recovery eddys below the holes. Creek turns left again and
enters 'Werewolf'. Enter on the slide right and catch the right eddy,
ferry back to the left above the Fang rock and down through the series of
holes. A couple nice ledge drops follow before the entrance to the
'Funnel'. Again trees growing in the middle of the rock garden hide the
horizon line. Enter right and punch the ledge hole, and ride the flume
down through a couple more holes into the eddy-pool below. Several more
good rock jumbles follow. Be on the look for a rapid where the flume
narrows to 10-12 feet and ends in a house sized boulder on the left bank as
the creek cuts sharp right. A large eddy to the left is a good place to
stop and prepare for 'The Slot'. The creek bends back to the left and cuts
back right as it funnels between two large boulders slanting in from each
bank. Build up speed to punch the entrance wave-holes and the final hole
at the bottom. This hole has provided numerous creekboat rodeos. The meat
of the hole is river left, but the right bank below the hole is undercut,
so the best line is to punch through the center. The eddy/pool below feeds
a 5 foot offset ledge drop. The left bank below the drop is very sharp
limestone. Best line is to boof straight of the far right side, but avoid
the left edge of the right half of the ledge or you will likely piton on  
 the lip and fall into the hole. Some more class III follows to the
confluence with Richland. Paddlers need to be very, very confident
on Richland before trying this run. It is a mean little steep creek,
on par with Beech or Shop Cr., only shorter. Thanks go to Cowper
Chadbourn and Lance Jones for a description of this one.

Boen Gulf Cr.
Rating: IV-V
TDCR: ????
Location: Newton Co.; To reach the put-in, follow Hwy 21 south from
Boxley toward Mossville. After you pass Mossville, look for a
bermed road on your right that has a large turnout area where
several cars can be parked near the highway. This is the access
for Paradise Falls described in Tim Ernst's Arkansas Waterfalls
book. Park and drag over the berm and down the old logging road.  
 The hike to the creek is about a half mile total, but it's not
too bad a brushwhack if you can manage to stay on the old roads.  
 Pass the first road trace that turns to the right and continue
as the main road bears to the left (south). Take the next old
road trace downhill on the right and follow it as it heads down
and back to the northwest. The next turn is very hard to find.
You'll pass one road trace going downhill toward the creek on your
left, but keep going a bit further and take the second one. This
one barely looks like a road anymore, and it's easy to get lost in
the woods on the way down. If you follow it correctly, you'll
intersect the creek very high up in the watershed at an elevation
of about 1980 feet,just above a 5-foot ledge where the old road
crosses the creek. Ernst's book and a good GPS and compass are
very helpful. It's a good idea to hike down this trail before
you have a chance to run the creek, just to make sure you can find
it!
Topo Quad(s): Fallsville, Boxley
Gradient: 230 fpm (300 fpm max)
Length: 10.25 mi. (2.75 miles on Boen Gulf plus 7.5 miles on Hailstone Cr.)
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: The USGS Buffalo at Boxley should be very high - 8+ feet is a good
indicator. However, if you wait for the gauge to update, you may have
missed the water. Look for 2.5+ inches of rain in just a few hours on
the Buffalo Tower and Swain rain gauges and get there when the rain
stops to catch the creek. Smith Cr. is a good indicator - look at
Smith from the Hwy 21 bridge. If it's muddy and running high, you
probably will have enough water on Boen Gulf. The only way to be
sure is to jog down to the creek and climb back out to either boat
or drive on - not an easy task, but one that can avert the unpleasant
experience of dragging a boat back up the hill if the water level
is in doubt.
LINK BUFFALO NATIONAL R. GAUGES (UPDATED HOURLY)
Hazards: strainers, severely undercut rocks, severe rapids, hydraulics,
waterfalls, etc.
Description: Boen Gulf sheds more total gradient than just about any
other Ozark steep creek. Dropping 650 feet in just under three miles,
it falls from the top of the Ozark plateau down to the Buffalo River
valley through three distinct gorges. The put-in elevation of 1980
feet is probably the highest anywhere in the Ozarks; you're still in
the nosebleed section when you launch your boat. The rapids range
from fairly tame to some of the wildest drops yet attempted in
Arkansas. If you can find the put-in (no small feat), the creek
starts by dropping over a small ledge with a punchy hole into a
large eddy on the right in a shallow cave. This starts the first
gorge of the creek, but the rapids are relatively tame class III
for the next 1/4 mile. You probably should be scraping some rocks
here, or the level downstream may be more than you want in places!
The first big drop presents a large horizon line and warrants a scout.
"Dog Barf Falls" is a fairly straightforward ledge, but it foreshadows
bigger things to come! After Dog Barf are two very rocky drops
back-to-back. At all but the highest water levels, these will need
to be portaged down to the next confluence. A creek merging from the
left doubles the flow - a common occurrence on the way down Boen Gulf.
There are always trees to contend with in the next couple of miles,
and the current doesn't slow down very often, so be alert. Just after
a small drop into a creek-wide hole, get out at the top of a low-angle
slide to scout "Paradise Falls" on the left bank. It's hard to see
the bottom from the top - a rope to rappel down somewhere on the left
side of the gorge is an excellent idea. Paradise is about as impressive
as it gets in the Ozarks: a fast slide with some tricky diagonal
holes feeds a near-vertical fall that is 25+ feet high. The water
explodes off of rifts in the rock face on the way down creating ominous
looking rooster tails before it all crashes into a big hole at the
bottom. The fall has been run several times, but high-volume creek
boats with blunt, rockered bows are essential gear. A feasible line
is down the middle of the drop, hopefully maintaining an upright
attitude all the way down. This is class V creekin at its finest, and
the portage on the left may be nastier than running the drop! After
leaving Paradise, the creek settles down as it emerges from the first
gorge. Dozens of class III drops, and at least one tougher rapid are on
the agenda until the creek seems to disappear into a big pile of rocks.
Get out on the left to scout or on the right to portage the next 1/8
mile. This is the second gorge consisting of large drops with many
hazardous undercuts and sieves. A large siphon under the rock in
the last drop awaits any swimmers, forming a deadly, hidden trap.
This is nasty, class V+ water that most boaters will want to portage
in its entirety. At the end of the ugly gradient is a small pool
leading into a jumbled drop on the right that feeds onto a low-angle
slide. Catch an eddy at the end of the slide where rocks push the creek
to the far left into a slot. This is "Smack Yer Bottom", a ten-foot
spout landing on a bedrock slide. The impact at the bottom will hit
you very hard with a landing that is too flat or too steep. A screw
up in the churning slot above could result in very serious injuries.
The portage on the right side is simple. The slide continues down
to another creek confluence that marks the end of the second gorge.
The rapids mellow out for a short while, but a third gorge awaits!
You'll suddenly find yourself looking for eddies among the rocks.
The creek twists and drops constantly for the next 1/3 mile. Some
drops that might be singled out are "Huck & Duck," where a huge dead
tree on the first descent forced everyone to duck while running a
slot drop into an undercut rock, "Splat To Hell," where a relatively
easy looking drop bends sharply right, pushing into a boiling pile
that will trap wayward boaters in a sieve on the left, and
"Double Crack," which presents two interesting ways to vertically
pin at the same spot in the midle and a potentially nasty surf
on the sneak route on the far right. This section presents dozens
of opportunities for pins and is basically one long class IV+ rapid
when the water is up good. Just before reaching the Hailstone, the
rapids ease up and the gorge recedes. The Hailstone will no doubt
be in flood, with lots of huge waves and big holes to deal with. On
the first descent, the group made it down Boen Gulf in good shape,
but had multiple swimmers in the willow jungles on the Hailstone
just above Boxley. Don't let your guard down! The first known descent
was made on 5/16/2003 by Bill "Fish" Herring, Noah Fraiser, Lance
"Lazer" Jones, Ray Skinner, Billy Williams, Mike Oglesby, and
Kyle Bogard. Obviously Boen Gulf is only suitable for boaters
comfortable on steep, class IV+ water who have their helmets
strapped on tight!

Boss Hollow
Rating: IV-V _
TDCR: ????
Location: Turn West from Hwy 7 at the "Who Would Have Thought It Gift
Shop". Take the left hand fork about 1.2 miles to the 6th
drive/road to the left. Park and carry or drive 0.75 mile
(4WD only) to a gate. An ATV trail leads downhill just
before the gate. Drag downhill about 0.5 miles to put-in
(elevation 1560 ft). Reach the take out by taking the right
fork at the gift shop down the hill to Hurricane Creek
put-in. At the bottom of the hill the road forks. The left
fork fords a creek. If the creek is high park here and carry
boats out 0.5 mile. If crossable, drive 0.5 mile to house
on right in left hand bend. Ask permission to park in the
clearing provided by landowner (Very nice!)
Topo Quad(s): Deer, Fort Douglas, Lurton, Sand Gap
Gradient: 200 fpm
Length: 4 mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Gage at Richland Campground needs to be above 6. Look for
1.5 inches or more rain at the Deer and Ben Hur rain gages, as
posted on the ACC Resource Page. Rain must have fallen
within the last 6 to 12 hours. If the small creek at the
bottom of the take-out road is to the point you think
about not driving across, it's a definite run!
Hazards: Undercut ledges and rocks, overhanging branches, strainers,
waterfalls. Very tight in places (pinning hazzards).
Vertical pins possible on left side of "THE BOSS". Avoid
"The Undercut"!
Description: First known descent was December 17, 1995. By Cowper
Chadbourn, Chris Anderson, Chris Jones, Nathan Kline, and
Lance Jones. The creek starts out fast and narrow dropping
over several small slides and ledges. The run is 2 miles on
Boss Hollow (200 fpm with 400 fpm max) then 2
miles on Buck Branch (80 fpm). Approximately 0.25
miles into the run there is a small ledge into a pool. Now the
tight and technical section starts. Lots of pin possibilities
here. This is where the Toilet Bowl and Baby Boss
Slide are encountered. These are followed shortly by
Face Slap Falls and Sycamore Slot. After several more
extended fast continuous rapids there is another small
ledge into a pool. The exit to the pool is usually
cluttered/blocked with logs. Scout on the right bank. This
is the entrance to THE BOSS, a very serious drop. This
is the combination of the entrance to the big
slide (Performance Evaluation), the big slide
(Broken Paddle) and the last ledge (Half A Paddle).
Pick your way around the wood or carry. Run down the
main channel to the left through a slot, over a ledge
and down a narrow slide and hang a 90 degree right to the
big slide. Make sure you slide down the right half of the
slide to avoid the nasty vertical pins on the left side.
The last ledge into a small pool can create a strong
hydraulic. Very shortly (100-150 yds) the creek takes a
sharp turn to the left and funnels down a 3-4 ft. wide
slot. This is "The Undercut!" A large house foundation
sized slab rock at least 50% undercut. Run as far left as
possible. (up on the wall is my preferred route) The next
0.25 mile to Buck Branch is known as Cheesegrater. A
long continuous shoal with several surf holes. At low
water it feels like a your sliding down a cheesegrater.
(At least your boat will be lighter for the carry out!).
The final 2 miles down Buck Branch have many class III
drops and several play spots. Take out just above
Hurricane Creek at house beside the creek. Like other
micro-volume creeks, meaningful ratings are difficult to
establish on the accepted International scale. At lower
levels, the creek will seem like a very technical Class
III, with much rock bashing, scraping, and some portages.
At higher levels, several rapids are expected to become
solid Class V. Either way, because of the hazards,
Boss Hollow should be treated with a lot of respect. Make
sure you're ready for a serious run before putting in.

great Ozark creek!)

Boulder Cr.
Rating: IV-V+ (P)
TDCR: 9996
Location: Newton Co.; Put-in is near Mt. Sherman and Kyles Landing
on Hwy. 74. You're looking for a dirt road leading steeply
downhill roughly across from the road to Kyles Landing.
It should go down quickly to some pastures and you want to
stay right past a house on your right. Just past this
the road turns ugly and only determined 4WD will make it
to the bottom. About 150 yards downhill is an old
abandoned shack of a house. Assemble gear here and then
hike straight down the old road to the creek about 75 yards
downhill. The takeout is reached by following the Mt. Sherman
Cemetery Road south toward Diamond Cave. Park on the LEFT
(creek) side of the road just upstream of the slab stream
crossing. Do not block the driveway on right side.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Jasper, Parthenon
Gradient: 250 fpm (1.25 mile @ >500 fpm)
Length: 2.75 mi
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Only runnable after extended heavy rainfall.
Buffalo R. should be over 2 or 3 ft. over the Ponca bridge.
Beech Cr. should have plenty of water. The creek should
look flush with water at the takeout - unless it's raining,
you'll lose most of the flow by the time you finish the run.
Hazards: continuous severe rapids, unrunnable boulder sieves,
numerous undercut rocks, keeper hydraulics, numerous strainers
Description: Boulder is not your typical Ozark steep creek run.
The vital statistics of the creek are sobering for paddlers.
First, the gradient is amazing: 250 fpm average, but that
includes a 60 fpm half mile at the end. The steepest part
is found in a quarter mile near the end, known simply as
The Falls, that drops almost 200 ft in that distance. The
creek also lives up to its name; huge boulders abound creating
nearly continuous and blind class IV-V rapids mixed with
sieves of questionable runnability. And the watershed is
large by Ozark standards - the lower two miles of the creek
is fed by runnoff from almost four square miles of land.
A trip down Boulder Cr. sets the paddler up for a full day
of mental and physical stress testing that is unrivaled
anywhere in the state (and few places in the country).
The first attempt on the creek was made on 11/7/96 by
Bill and Chanoy Herring and Kevin Fendley. A 3/4 mile
section of the creek was completed before an injury
forced the group to hike out of the gorge. The first
successful run of the gorge happened during the memorable
"Earth Day Floods" on April 23, 2004, when Zach Williams,
Sean Ruggles, and Bill Herring completed the entire trip
at an optimal level with around a dozen portages. This
group knew the creek intimately after numerous pre-run hikes,
but the trip still required more than 7 hours to complete -
despite an early start, the takeout was reached just before
nightfall. Hiking the creek dry before running it should
be considered a requirement (hike from the takeout up, not
the put-in down), and consideration should be given to
identifying landmarks for scouts and portages in advance.
The creek begins just below an old abandoned house as a
tiny stream and immediately plunges over an angled fall
with a bad landing, followed by a ledge into an undercut
grotto. It looks a bit dicey, but the creek dishes out
far worse for the next three miles - if the first drop
gives you pause, a hike back to your vehicle is still an
option. The rapids are typically class III with small
eddies for the next third of a mile, with a few tricky
spots thrown in for good measure. The Upper Gorge rears
its ugly head when a large jumble blocks the stream under
a pretty dripline bluff on the left. This drop feeds into
a severely undercut boulder - scout with care. From here
the creek alternates between bouts of relatively tranquil
water and pure class V mayhem for the next quarter mile
or so. If there aren't too many trees, it is all runnable,
though questionable at times. Scouting is difficult but
essential, and these rapids must be gotten through or around
quickly since the water level is probably dropping out
fast and there is a lot of creek left to boat. In the middle
of this is maybe the biggest sheer drop on the creek -
"Hang A Lefty". It's an 8-foot ledge onto a rock shelf on the
right, but the current helps funnel you left into the
undercut base of the drop - no worries! When you see/feel
two tributaries kick in and the gradient slack up, be ready
to get out. The "Strainer Strainer" is rock sieve through
which not much will pass - portage right. Class III water
provides some rest for the next quarter mile, and then
the class IV+ "Pretzel" signals the start of the Lower Gorge.
The bottom part of this rapid may not go at low levels.
The infamous "Elbow" follows - a very long class V rapid
consisting of multiple tricky ledges followed by a sharp
turn into an ugly-looking hole. The only reasonable scout
is from river right. The next half mile presents an almost
constant barrage of long, complex, blind drops. This is
a very intense section of water, but all drops are boatable
under the right conditions. When the bottom looks like it
is really starting to drop out, it is. This is "The Falls",
so get out on either bank to scout and portage the next
quarter mile. The long lead-in is solid class V (V+?) water
that roughly ends at a drop called the "Pearly Gate" - a
steep plunge between two boulders into a wicked looking hole.
Past this is "Salvation Eddy", a semi-pool of water
on the right bank. Failure to reach Salvation will
result in a severe pummeling in the monster class VI cascade
that follows. Even the hairiest of boaters will want
to carefully consider this section - even just standing on
the bank comptemplating the ramifications of an attempt
at running this incredible chunk of gradient can be a
quasi-religious experience. The carry down to the small
pool below is not as bad as it first appears, and after
the pool, a long, complex series of drops through
boulders leads into the base of a large cliff with a
cave in its base on river left. "Cliff Rapid" is just
above the cliff, and unfortunately a large seive in
the middle of the drop is not runnable except at very
high levels. It's hard to see this without careful scouting,
so make sure you see the entire rapid before committing to
it. The class III-IV water after Cliff may seem easy by
comparison, but don't relax too soon. Just When You Thought
It Was Over, a tricky class IV+, comes in this stretch and
another long, difficult rapid follows it. From here to
Panther Creek is solid class III+ water with some holes to
beware of (the worst is a ledge right at the confluence
with Panther). Take a deep breath and paddle through
fast class II-III water for the next third of a mile down
to the takeout. Kiss the ground and walk up to run your
shuttle. Boulder Cr. should obviously not be taken lightly.  
 It is a serious, all-day undertaking suitable only for a
team of well-prepared class V creek boaters. Dozens of
class V drops must be run or portaged quickly, often
without good bank scouting or support, since water levels
drop quickly and virtually the whole creek can sieve out.
Expect a great deal of serious hiking/climbing though
jungles of poison ivy and you will not be disappointed!

Broadwater Hollow
Rating: IV-V
TDCR: ????
Location: Newton Co.; Take Hwy. 43 north from Compton about 1/2
mile and take the dirt road on your right that's across
from the fire station building. Head downhill for 2
miles on the dirt road until you reach a small creek
crossing over a rock slab. If there's a lot of water
covering the slab and it's moving really fast,
you're good to go! Paddle down to Cecil Cr. about
1/4 mile down and then carry back up on the left side
of Broadwater on the hiking trail that leads back to
the put-in. The hike takes about 20-30 minutes dragging
a kayak.

LINK BUFFALO NATIONAL R. GAUGES (UPDATED HOURLY)
Hazards: undercuts, downed trees, and one spine crushing drop
Description: First run in the epic Earth Day Flood on April 24, 2004
by Fish, Otter, Zach Williams, Sean Ruggles, Amanda
Boster, and Trey Marley, this is the premier Park-N-Creek
run of the Ozarks. The access is simple and no shuttle is
needed. Just jump in your boat and hang on - though scouting
down the creek on the left trail is a good idea for first
timers. The run starts with long slide that finishes with
a seven foot spout that was first run by Sean Ruggles
backwards after a tightly spaced group launch turned
into an ugly traffic jam halfway down the slide. This author
can attest to the rather surprised look in Sean's eyes
as he disappeared into the froth! The drop's named
"Clusterf\*\*k" - watch out for the eddy on the left and if
there's much water at all expect to get backendered. If you
had fun, the carry back up to run it again is not hard at all.
The next drop is one of the more visually impressive drops
in the Ozarks. Nicknamed "Honcho", this twisting falls
lands on a slab of limestone, making varying degrees of
spinal abuse possible if not likely. Honcho is a solid
class V drop, probably V+ at high water levels. It's easy
to portage on the left, and unless you're feeling invincible
that's probably the best route to the bottom. Next is another
long slide at high speed and then a jumble of rocks that
makes for a nice class III-IV drop. A couple of eddies lead
over a class III+ entrance rapid and a tiny eddy above the
lip of "Rock Slide". This 10-foot plunge over a house-
sized boulder looks more intimidating from the entrance than
it is, but there's relatively little room for error since
it immeditately feeds into some rocks and then into the
next series of drops. The next 100 yards of class IV-V
water is the "Broadwater Boogie". A good scout and some
strategic bank support can prevent minor mishaps from
turning epic here. Depending on water level, you'll
either be trying to speed up to boof or slow down to not get
smashed into the rocks. There probably isn't a completely
clean line down the whole thing, and well laid plans tend
to unravel before the bottom eddy is reached. The next
and final drop, "Big Ugly", is only runnable at very high
water levels over the double drop in the center of the
creek. Water flows through cracks in the huge rock making
any line potentially hazardous. Scout from the rocks
in the center, and if it doesn't look pleasant, just carry
up the left bank to the trail. Cecil Creek lies at the
bottom of Big Ugly - make sure you take out there or it
will be a very long walk back to the car! If you get on
the creek at high levels and run it quickly, you can go
for round #2 if you have enough energy left, but expect
a much bonier run unless it's pouring rain. Not running
the first drop again would be a shame though - it boats
well even with very low flow. Or, if you have a lot of
time, head over for a chaser on Osage Cr., which should
have plenty of water left! Broadwater is extremely steep
and boaters should definitely be experienced at class V
steep creekin' before launching a boat!

LINK TO USGS GAUGE
Hazards: none
Description: The Buffalo is the first U.S. National River. It is
exceedingly rich in history and beauty. A discussion of this
river is far beyond the scope of this humble document. Suffice
it to say that it would be difficult to find a more spectacular
river anywhere in the world. The whitewater is at its best
in the spring on the upper sections from Boxley to Kyle's
Landing. But the whitewater is not the primary reason to float
this river. The towering, multi-colored bluffs, the clear,
cool, green water, and the abundant wildlife (including some
imported elk) are the main attractions. See Tom Kennon's
guidebook "Ozark Whitewater" or one of the many books
written about the Buffalo for more information on this fantastic
river. If you catch the river at high water, check out the
good kayak play run from Boxley to Ponca. This stretch is
more challenging than the downstream sections, and it
is the only one you can run when the Park Service closes the
river due to high water.

Cedar Cr.
Rating: II+
TDCR: 4444
Location: Crawford Co.; Take Hwy. 282 west from I-540 to Rudy, then
take the Hobbtown Rd. north from Rudy to Hobbtown. There is
a put-in on the East Fork of Cedar Cr. at Hobbtown (adds
about a mile to the run). To get to the West Fork of Cedar
follow Hwy. 162 west from Hobbtown. Put in at the bridge.
The take out is on the Frog Bayou in Rudy. Other
put-ins/take-outs are possible on the many county roads
in the area.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Rudy
Gradient: 50 fpm
Length: 7 mi.
Season: RAIN
Gauge: The Frog Bayou should be probably be running at least 5 ft.
for a run. Also there is a gauge is on the west side of the western
most bridge abutment on Hwy 348. This gauge should be at least zero
inches for a run on Cedar Cr. and 4 inches for a run on the West Fork
or East Fork (above the confluence). There is also a gauge on the Hwy
162 bridge over the West Fork but it isn't graduated or calibrated.
The gauge is located on the upstream side of the west bridge abutment.
You need water to the bottom of that gauge to run the West Fork.
Hazards: mostly strainers
Description: This run is a fun class II to II+ run down a small, swift
creek. Many different runs are possible. The most play oppoutunities
can be found on the West Fork between the Hwy 162 bridge and the
confluence with the East Fork. The surfing in this stretch is some
of the best in the state, with continous waves and holes. The first
major hole below the 162 bridge can be a boat keeper at high levels,
so have a good plan for getting out before you get in. The East Fork
can also be boated from the Hwy. down. It is a smaller, steeper stream,
but it doesn't have the quality surfing spots of the West Fork. Watch
out for an 8 foot high dam that must be portaged on the East Fork
about a mile below the 162 bridge. Watch for strainers and trees that
can be hazardous on most of the creek, but which are especially bad on
the East Fork. Also beware of some barbed wire strands on the East Fork
near a small low-water crossing. The bridge at the confluence of the
East and West forks makes a good take out for the Fork runs or a
good put in when the water is too low upstream. Drive to this bridge
from Hobbtown Rd. (to the East of Cedar Cr.). The lower part of
Cedar Cr. has many good rapids and playspots in the 5 miles to the
Frog Bayou. It can often be boated when the West Fork and East Fork
are too low to paddle. Cedar Cr. is a great alternative to a run on
Lee Cr. and it is often running when Lee is running. Like Lee, the
two miles of the West Fork of Cedar Cr. is a great afternoon play run.

Clear Cr.
Rating: II-III
TDCR: 3333
Location: Crawford Co.; Take Hwy 71 north of I-40 to the Hwy 282
junction just north of Mountainburg. Take Hwy 282 west to
Chester. Put in at the Hwy 282 bridge in Chester. (Park
downstream river right just below the bridge.) Take out at
Ash St. low water bridge in Mountainburg (see Frog Bayou, S1
for more info.)
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Mountainburg
Gradient: 30 - 40 fpm
Length: 3 mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: The USGS Frog Bayou gauge should be above 5 ft. for a
good run. Another good indicator is less than 1 ft. of airspace
under the Ash St. bridge. If there is more than 1 ft. of water
over the bridge, the run will be dangerous due to extremely
heavy water on the Frog.
Hazards: mostly strainers and some heavy water on the Frog. Also
beware of construction work for I-540 in several areas.
At the time of this writing the creek passes through
some culverts in three places and the areas are littered with
rebar and other hazards.
Description: The first two-thirds of this run is on Clear Cr. The
boating in this section is fast paced with many good class II+
drops. The first surfing opportunity comes immediately below
the put-in bridge where enders are possible at high levels.
Another spectacular surfing wave resides less than 1/2 mile
down as the creek bends sharply to the left. This portion
of the creek is similar to Lee Cr., but it is much narrower.
Beware of the areas near and under the three I-540 bridges, as
these areas contain debris left over from highway construction.
Also, beware of some protruding rebar on the river right side
of a train trestle just below the third I-540 bridge. Just
downstream of this trestle, a ledge in the middle of a class
II rapid provides a great spot for surfing and 360 spins.
After the confluence with the Frog Bayou at the end of the
second mile, the character of the run changes completely. The
paddler is now on a full sized river, and the flow triples.
Heavy class II+ water is encountered for the next 3/4 mile
until the take-out is reached. There are usually some bad
strainers below the confluence, and the current can easily
push an unprepared boater into them. The run is fairly fast,
usually requiring less than two hrs. If you are more pressed
for time, consider taking out or putting in at the upper I-540
bridge. Take care not to trespass on the banks since most of
the land surrounding the creek is privately owned. Boaters
should have very good boat control in class II-III rapids
before putting on Clear Cr.

Hazards: strainers, Johnson's Squeeze (V)
Description: The upper section of the EFLB, as it is locally known,
is a classic Ozark creek run. At the confluence of Barberry
Cr. the EFLB is a very small steep creek, but it picks up
volume from three tributaries in the first mile and becomes
a sizable creek run. Half Moon (III) is the first
notable drop encountered followed by Johnson's Squeeze (V)
where the creek is severely choked down. Portage Johnson's
Squeeze on the left, and beware of entering the upper part
of the drop accidentally. You may be forced to fight for
your life in the Squeeze, as it's namesake, Jon Johnson, can
attest to. Although it certainly is not recommended, the
Squeeze has been a handfull of times with varying success.  
 The first runs were on the right at very high water
by Ryan Johnson (4/22/96), and then on the left crack side
(2/21/97) by Mr. Johnson as well. Don't try this
at home boys and girls. It's a definite hazard to life
and limb at any level. Numerous class III and III+ rapids are
encountered below the Squeeze and some of the best scenery
in the Ozarks surrounds padders in this stretch. After this
first gorge, the gradient relaxes a bit. When the creek
looks like a blind jumble of boulders again, you're at the
start of the class III-IV Second Gorge. It starts with
a mean hole with a twisting approach nicknamed "Obliterator" - a name often deserved at high levels when the hole
tends to efficiently separate boaters and gear. A rope
here and a look at the lines are both good ideas. Drops
are continuous and blind for the next quarter mile,
and at high water the area is basically one long class IV+
rapid. It's fun, but it's serious fun - there are sieves
and hazards lurking in many places, so stay on your toes.
After the Second Gorge, the gradient again eases, but
class III drops keep appearing. Just after a driveway
crossing with a house and barn on the left, an easy class
III drop leads to a short pool above "Swinging Bridge Drop."
Just look for the old footbridge above the rapid. This
begins the Third Gorge, about the same intensity and length
as the Second, but with a very different personality.
The hardest drops come at the end, and don't relax too
soon, because a class III+ drop with a brusing landing
zone appears after you think the gorge is over (there
is a sneak to the left). There is a possible takeout
point at a low water bridge about a mile below the
Third Gorge, just past where Stepp Cr. enters from the
left, or you can continue down to the Murray takeout.
All boaters should have good creeking skills on
class III-IV water before attempting the EFLB. It's
one of the best runs around if you have the skills,
but it's a long a bruising day if you don't!

East Fork of the White R.
Rating: II _
TDCR: 1332
Location: Madison County. Take Hwy 16 south from Durham, go approx.
three miles, then the highway will curve to the left and go
uphill. At top of the hill will be a gravel road to the left.
The road is easy to recognize because it cuts through an
exposed layer of red clay. Follow the road to the take-out
(should be obvious). The turn for the put-in is approximately
1.75 miles down (South) of the highway from the turn-off for
the take-out. Cross over one bridge, go up a hill then across
another drainage then take the first left on a gravel road.
The road is marked by a stop sign. Follow it to a bridge
which is the put-in.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Durham
Gradient: less than 20 fpm
Length: 1.75 mi.
Season: FALL, SPRING
Gauge: No real gauge, but the Mulberry should be relatively high
(> 4.5 ft.) for a good run.
Hazards: Some strainers, bad hydraulics at high water levels
Description: For some reason not many paddlers are aware of this run,
probably because there are many more challenging runs up when
this one is optimal. However it is a great afternoon float
for paddlers near Fayetteville due to the short shuttle and
the large watershed above the run which maintains a floatable
level for up to a week after a good rain. It is a good
training run for beginners, offering several chances to
practice eddy hopping and ferrying. When the river
begins to turn to the left and a tributary enters on the
right, the river channel begins to narrow signaling the
proximity of Flat Rock Rapid. This rapid begins as a chute
flowing over a ledge that creates some nice surfing waves,
then it opens up and flows over sandstone bedrock creating
mucho surfing waves. At the bottom of the rapid the bedrock
ends and creates more waves and turbulence. The short pool
just past the trough is great for recovery. There is a short
class II- rapid just below Flat Rock Rapid, which,
unfortunately, signals the end of the run. Paddle through a
long pool to the take-out. Thanks to Steve Robertson for
information on this run.

Rating: II-IV
TDCR: 5666
Location: Washington and Crawford Co.; Take Hwy 71 north from I-40 to
West Fork, then take Hwy 170 south and then Hwy 265 west to
Strickler. Put in at Hwy 265 bridge at Strickler. Take out
at low water bridge on Hwy 220 (dirt road) south of Devil's
Den State Park.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Strickler, Rudy NE
Gradient: 50 fpm (80 fpm. in first 2.5 miles)
Length: 12 mi.
Season: RAIN
Gauge: The bridge at the takeout near Lee Cr. should have water flowing
over it for a minimal run. More than 1.5 ft of water over
this bridge will make for a class IV run in the upper six
miles. The USGS gauge for Baron Fork at Dutch Mills is also
a good predictor for this run. It should be over 4.0 ft. for
a run on Fall Cr.
LINK TO USGS GAUGE
Hazards: hydraulics, strainers, barbed wire (2 fences at end of 6th
mile), undercuts
Description: This creek was first run by Steve Robertson and crew in
open boats in May 1995. The lower 6 miles were run in Jan.
1993 by Bill and Chanoy Herring. The first 4 miles are the
toughest, containing many class III+ drops in a very narrow
stream bed. "Threes with trees" is the best way to describe
this dangerous stretch. At high water there are very few eddies
and no pools to recover in. Some of the more notable rapids
include Introduction (III) just below the put-in bridge,
Poke in the Eye (III) about 2.5 miles into the run, and
Hal's Falls (III) at mile 5.0 which sports a terminal, river-
wide hydraulic at higher levels. 1/2 mile below Hal's Falls
watch out for two mean strands of barbed wire that span the
creek. The first fence appears at the end of a rapid where
water pillows off of several car sized rocks in the middle of
the stream. It is best portaged on the right. The second
fence follows about 1/4 mile after the first, just as a large
overhanging bluff on river left ends. Portage on the left.  
 These fences are extremely dangerous and difficult to spot
from upstream. Also there are barbed wire strands in the
creek between the two fences. Stay near the left bank to
avoid these strands. Though it's tempting, do not attempt
to cut or move these fences. The landowner is within his
rights to have them there, and he could cause major trouble
for boaters if his property is destroyed. Also beware of the
potential for strainers that can block the entire creek in
many places. Plan on portaging at least a few times. The
gradient lessens in the last half of the run providing more
time to recover, but there are still many trees in the fast
current so stay on your toes. You may want to put on early,
because it can easily take you more than six hours to run the
12 miles, and more time can easily be consumed unpinning
wayward boats and paddlers. All boaters should be confident
on fast class III-IV water and familiar with strainer hazards
before attempting Fall Cr.

approximate level using the Buffalo R. river and rain gauges
which are linked below.
LINK BUFFALO NATIONAL R. GAUGES (UPDATED HOURLY)
Hazards: strainers, Falling Water Falls
Description: A tributary to Richland Cr., Falling Water is a great
whitewater run in its own right. It's packed full of terrific
scenery and some great drops, most notably Falling Water Falls,
a sheer 10 footer 6 miles upstream of the Richland confluence.
Much of the creek can be scouted from the road that parallels
it 80% of the time. The stream bed is extremely narrow in
the first 3 miles, and at high water the class III rapids
tend to come at you very fast with few eddies to scout from.
Watch out for the ever present deadfalls that can make you
wish you'd worn some hiking boots. While not as punishing as
Richland's gorge, Falling Water is more technical and all
boaters should be strong intermediates. In high water,
be an expert boater and hold onto your hat!

Falls Branch
Rating: III-V _
TDCR: ????
Location: Put-in: Go North on Hwy 123 at Lurton to Spence Junction.
To the right is a dirt road which is the way to Richland.
There is a large pond on the left (this is the headwaters
to Falls Branch) Go North on Hwy 123 for ~1.25 miles to the
next dirt road on the right. (Shulers Point) Go ~0.7 miles
on this road to a parking area in front of a burmed road on
the right. Drag South down the old roadbed to a field and
then down from the left (East) edge of the field to the
creek. Target is just above the junction of the two upper
branches where the old roadbed crosses. (Elevation 1830)
Reach the take-out by going back to Spence Junction and
heading East on the dirt road. Take lefts at the two major
intersections and head North on FR 1200 down the mountain
toward Bass. Park on the side of the road near the low
water bridge. (Elevation 890) The Shulers Point road does
go down the hill to the confluence of Falls Branch and Cave
Creek, but the FS gated it in the summer of 2001. But it
could be used as an emergency access.
Topo Quad(s): Lurton
Gradient: 150 fpm, (300+ fpm max)
Length: 9 mi (4 on Falls Branch)
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Gage at Richland Campground should to be above 6 or headed
that way. Look for 1.5" or more rain at the Deer, Ben Hur
and Mt. Judea rain gages, at the BNR Data Page. Rain must
have fallen within the last 6 to 12 hours. If the Pond at
Spence Junction is spilling lots of water, it should be a
run!
Hazards: Undercut ledges and rocks, overhanging branches, strainers,
waterfalls.
Description: First known descent was April 22, 1996. By Cowper
Chadbourn, Chris Anderson, Howard Elliot, Walter Felton
(OC-1), Bob Hoffman, Lance Jones, Nate Kline, Robert Orr,
Ted Smethers and Billy Williams. Falls Branch is a
4.5-mile run down to Cave Creek, with and average gradient
of 150 ft/mile, the first mile being 300 ft/mile. Due to
closure of the 4WD road to the confluence, an additional
4-5 mile paddle to the community of Bass is required. The
creek starts out on bedrock with a short slide followed by
a 10-12 foot waterfall just below the confluence of the
upper forks. There is a large rock in the left center of
the drop and a narrow line to land in just right of
center. Exit through one of two slots and over a 6-foot
waterfall. Now get ready for lots of action with very
tight slots and boulder jumbles. Little bedrock is
encountered for the next 0.25 miles. Many of the boulder
jumbles offer pin and undercut dangers compounded with
possible wood. Note: the first run occurred after a series
of wind storms resulting in a very large number of trees down
across the creek. Portaging these trees was a major chore
and led to the renaming of the creek by the paddlers as
'Dead' Falls Branch. Most of the drops were run. Once the
bedrock returns, have fun on the first couple of slides
but be on the lookout for the point where the slide takes
a sharp turn to the left in front of a large boulder. This
is 'Nate's Falls'. The drop is entirely on bedrock, but
two undercut boulders add some spice. Start with the
entrance turn to the left followed by a tight turn to the
right through a slot. The large boulder on the left bank
is undercut and may collect wood. Main route is to exit
far right and cut back left before dropping 10-12 feet
through a tight slot requiring a hard turn back to the
right. The crux is not pinning on the undercut boulder
forming the right side of the slot. Optional route (water
level and wood/debris dependent) is a straight line
through a slot between the boulders and down through the
final slot. Several more boulder jumbles and slides are
encountered shortly, topped off by a slot move into a
steep 12-15 foot slide drop into a grotto pool. Fast class
II-III water takes you from the next mile or so from the
tribuary on the right. Two small ledge drops signal the
approach of 'Surprise Turn'. The creek takes a hard turn
to the left as it drops between two boulders. As you enter
the white foaming maelstrom, you think "This is going to
be ugly!" But the foam is suprisingly forgiving and you
shoot out with a big smile. Stay to the center/left and
away from the undercut wall on the right and line up for
the next 5-6ft drop. Fast boogie water takes you to the
confluence with Cave Creek as the gradient starts to
subside. 80-100 ft/mile gradient continues downstream to
the takeout on FR 1200. Be aware of strainers and willow
jungles in this section. A road parallels the creek if
needed for portaging. Like other micro-volume creeks,
meaningful ratings are difficult to establish on
the accepted International scale. At lower levels, the
creek may seem like a very technical class III, with
much rock bashing, scraping, and some portages. At higher
levels, several rapids are expected to become solid
class V. In any case, paddlers need to be very
familliar with the hazards of small, steep Arkansas
creeks before attempting this run. Thanks to Lance
Jones for information about this great creek!

Fern Gulley
Rating: IV-V
TDCR: 9895
Location: Take out on Little Mill Cr. at the low water slab.
Put in is reached by heading north to Fern. Go past
Fern and turn off the pavement on the first gravel
road to the south (this road has a stop sign on it).
Follow the road downhill until the road does a couple
of semi-switchbacks. You'll have already passed
one pretty good road to the right, and you're looking
for the next one past the switchbacks. If you go just
past the road, you'll end up in a wide turn around where
the hunters like to camp, so if you get there, turn
back and take the first left. Follow the steep little
road downhill (4WD only!) until it switches back to the
left at a small creek. Go another 100 yards or so
and look for the rock-lined trail going down to the
right. The creek put-in is about 30 yards down this
trail. If you don't have 4WD, park up at the main
gravel road and walk down from there. An alternate,
but unpleasant, takeout if you're running short on
time is to carry back up the old logging road that
intersects the creek just past Rocket Slide.  
 (Actually there are old logging roads on the ridgetops
on either side of the creek all the way down.) This
road goes up through a split in the bluff and then into
a clear cut. Bear left and uphill and you can drag
up to the put-in in about 45 minutes. It's a heck of
a climb though!
Topo Quad(s): Mountainburg SE
Gradient: 300 fpm (0.5 mi @ 400 fpm)
Length: 4 mi (2.75 miles on Little Mill Cr.)
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: The Mulberry should be huge (10 feet) and rising on the USGS
gauge at Mulberry to have a chance at Fern Gulley. The
watershed is small and the creek is full of rocks - it
needs a lot of water to make a good run. Little Mill
Cr. should almost be covering all of the concrete of
the slab at the takeout. The best way to find out whether
it will run or not is to drive to the put-in, walk 30 yards
to the creek and check it. Ideally, there should be enough
water to form a rowdy looking hole at the base of the first
6-foot drop and the rocks in the main current should be
mostly covered. Unless it's raining, the water will be
dropping fast, so take this into consideration before putting
on at a really boney looking level. If you just see lots
of huge holes and no rocks, you probably should either wait
for the water to drop or go find another creek!
Hazards: Rapids are big, continuous, and dangerous. This is no place
for the unprepared. Pins are possible almost everywhere. Full-
face helmets and elbow pads are an excellent idea.
Description: Fern Gulley is the name given to the East Fork of Little
Mill Cr. by the local folks in Franklin Co. This creek is
the jewel of steep creeking in the southern Ozarks. When
full of water, it is easily one of the most difficult creeks
in the state. The creek features large, continuous drops with
almost no really good eddies. The run stays at a class IV
intensity level all the way, with no real breaks and some
notable class V interuptions. The lack of good eddies makes
it feel even steeper than its 300 fpm average gradient figure
(if that's possible), throwing at paddlers a constant barage of
steep rapids that seem to blend into each other for long stretches.
The creek begs for bank scouting at every turn, but since
the water level tends to drop out quickly, you can't spend
too much time on the banks. A pre-run hike is very highly
recommended. The first drop is called simply "The Test".  
 Those who fail to pass this class IV warm up, are urged
to consider walking back up to the car. The next half
mile of water is exactly the same - and then it gets much
tougher. Somewhere in the first quarter mile is a drop
called "Rooster Poot" (IV). This one looks like the rest,
but it ends in an ugly looking rooster tail. Portage on the
right if you can get stopped and don't want to risk a pin, or
try to angle right to avoid getting slammed into the rocks. The
first class V is encountered about 1/3 mile from the put-in,
just past the second major tributary stream cascading in on
the left. "Dumb and Dumber" is an ugly drop where the creek
is split by a big rock. The left side of this eight foot plunge
drops onto a roostertail rock and the right side dumps under a
huge rock. The approach is (as always) almost eddyless -
only boat what you can clearly see after Rooster Poot! At
Dumb and Dumber, go ahead and scout the next big class IV,
"Whack-A-Yaker". This is a big, twisting drop that dumps out
under a tree at the end. This one can mess with you - for
some reason it doesn't run as cleanly as it looks. The creek
lets up a bit at this point to a continuous class III slalom
through trees. When the creek turns back to the left, watch
for a major tree jam that requires a portage. Just past
these trees the creek gets very serious, so you might as well
stay on the banks and scout the next 200 yards. This is the
start of "The Drop Zone", and you won't want to enter it blind.
The left bank is really rocky, but it provides the best
look at the drops. The right bank is much easier for
portaging boats. The Drop Zone consists of a 200 yard
long staircase of fast, tough drops and tricky holes
that run headlong into each other creating a solid
class V rapid. There is no room for error when paddling
this rapid - this author can attest to the beating that
these drops can inflict upon those who are not on line!
The Drop Zone can conceivably be broken down into four parts
seperated by hard to catch eddies. The first part is a long,
multi-stage drop with plenty of rocks and holes. You can
then try to grab one of the small eddies - the last good
ones you'll see for a while - on either bank to stop before
part two of the Zone, known as "The Split". This is a
tough, pushy drop that is sometimes run to the left of
the pillowing rock, pulling hard right at the end to line
up for the three remaining ledge holes. Another unstable
eddy on the right preceeds part three - "Damned If You
Do". The creek twists left and drops about 10 feet
into two big holes before shooting out over a couple
of interesting looking drops around the corner. A small,
last chance eddy then appears just above the final
plunge - "Big Juju". Juju is a massive drop and the
route is complex and dangerous. A diagonal hole sits
between the eddy and the most feasible route on the left,
so expect it to kick you on the approach. If you are one
of the few who choose to test their luck in Juju, try to
precisely boof the first eight-foot drop to avoid the
vertical pin on the left and the pin rocks in the middle of
the drop. Assuming you are still upright and moving forward
after you clear the first rocks, you will hopefully carry
enough speed into the final hole to escape from it. If
you're determined to run the Drop Zone, set up bank support
in strategic locations and scout everything thoroughly. If
you think this is nice scenery but not runnable whitewater,
carry your boat around it high on the right bank. Below
Juju, the class IV drops keep comming. There are a couple
of large trees down in this stretch as well, and they
probably won't move anytime soon. After three or four
tricky class IV drops that should generally be run to the
right, a long slide starts. It's a good idea to get out
after the second drop below Juju and scout it, since
a downed tree near the bottom would likely knock your head
off your shoulders. This one is nicknamed the "Rocket Slide",
because you'll tend to launch into the air off of the
vertical ledges in the middle of the slide. Brace for
the curler as you drop into the funneling plunge at the
end, and don't forget to smile for the camera! Rocket Slide
is not that hard if you can avoid getting upside down (ouch!)
or surfed in the hole at the bottom. It's hard to believe
that any hole will stop you when you're moving 25 miles per
hour, but it is a possibility! The next 400 yards of the
creek is non-stop class III+ through trees. If you haven't
hiked out yet, you shouldn't have any trouble boat scouting
down this stretch. It may look strange, but you'll finally see
a small pool up ahead. Welcome to Little Mill Cr. Stop and
take a few breaths and get ready for nearly three more miles
of powerful class III-IV drops before you reach the take-out.
The first two major drops both feature big, sticky holes at
this level, so stay on your toes. If you run Fern Gulley at
below optimal levels, you may not be too impressed by the rock
bashing and sieve portaging. Running it with too much water
will force you into situations you don't want to be in.  
 The window for optimal levels is small, and even then, the
creek is no place for those who overestimate their skills. Hike
this one dry, and then follow someone who knows the creek if
you can. Fern Gulley was first run on March 19, 2002 by
Otter (aka Jason Bertschy), Mike Echols, Rob Polan, Danny Smith,
Nick Hobbs, "Crazy" Steve Brandenbura, and Fish (aka Bill
Herring), and they have the pictures to prove it!

Fishers Ford (Illinois R.)
Rating: I
TDCR: 1111
Location: The playspot is on the Illinois R. south of Siloam Springs.
Follow Hwy 16 West toward Siloam and turn on Hwy 244 West a short
time after you pass Lake Wedington. Follow 244 for a couple of
miles or so and take Cincinati Cr. Rd., a gravel road, to the north.
You can look for the old, white "Nicodemus Church" sign that is
mostly hidden by bushes at this turnoff. The Hwy 244 bridge
over Cincinati Cr., a medium sized creekbed with a gravel bottom,
is just past the turn you need to make, so if you cross it, you've
gone a bit too far. If you reach Hwy 59, you've gone a little over
a mile too far. Follow the gravel road north about a mile, and
you'll come to an intersection. Go straight on what is now
Fishers Ford Rd. The road makes a few bends, but just keep
following it north toward the river. When you come to the
old metal bridge, park on the river left, upstream of the bridge
and be sure to pull off the road. Don't block the little road
leading down to the river by the bridge, since local fishermen
use it to lauch johnboats. Unload and walk down to the river
and put in and paddle down about 100 yards to the ledge. When
you're finished playing, either paddle or walk back up the
streambed to get back to the bridge. Please respect landowners'
rights around this spot, and DON'T TRESPASS on the river banks
at the ledge, which are clearly posted. Ask permission
from the landowner in advance if you want to walk through
the field to reach the playspot. It's a long URL, and it
may change, but you can follow this link to get a
MapBlast map of the area. Zoom out on it to see how to come in
from Fayetteville or other towns.
Topo Quad(s): N/A
Gradient: N/A (just one rapid)
Length: N/A (100 yards to the rapid)
Season: ALL
Gauge: The USGS gauge on the Illinois R. at Siloam Springs should
be higher than 3.0 feet - but it always is. If the gauge is
over 5.0 feet, the river is flooding and the water quality
is about as bad as you can imagine. Due to heavy agricultural
runoff, it's best to wait a couple of days after heavy rains
before venturing out into the Illinois R.
Hazards: None. A big pool will catch wayward boaters at all but
the highest levels.
Description: This is the only summertime play spot for Northwest
Arkansas. If you don't go expecting a big rapid, you won't
be disappointed. But it is the only game in town in the dry
summer months, and the water is never to low to have some fun
and get a workout. It's actually a great spot for beginners
to hone their skills and practice rolls, ferries, catching
eddies, surfing, etc. It's about the least threatening
rapid in the state. The wave/hole varies with natural water
flow. At lower levels, a small wave and some decent squirt
lines are the attractions. With more water, a small hole forms
that can be side surfed. With even more water a larger
wave/hole appears and the well defined eddy lines vanish.
At the highest water levels, there is still a wave, but
the rapid is an e-coli mixing vat, due to a large amount
of agricultural waste runoff following heavy rains. Be sure
to carry or paddle back up the streambed to the bridge
when you're finished playing. The local landowners like
their privacy, and have posted the fields around the river.
Some will give you permission to cross the fields if you
ask in advance, but if you don't have permission, they're
probably not going to be happy when they catch you. Please
help promote good relationships with local landowners by
not blocking roads or paths with your vehicle and by
not trespassing on streamside property.

Season: FALL, SPRING
Gauge: Look for the USGS gauge at Rudy
to be between 2.7 and 5.0 feet for a good run.
Hazards: watch out for downed trees and strainers
Description: The Frog is an excellent class II run in the southern
Ozarks. The river stays at a runnable level for much of the fall
and spring and features a steady diet of class II and II+ drops
that will challenge beginning boaters. All of the sections from
Mountainburg down have some great rapids and all have the
potential for tree strainers to fall into the river, so watch
out for those hazards. The banks of the Frog are almost all
private property, so treat the land and landowners with respect.
At high water levels, the Frog can be run above L. Fort Smith,
and Clear Cr. is another challenging high water option, but
such runs are relatively rare. The stream can also be run below
Rudy, where it is a slower class I-II float. The section that
draws the most boaters is the section from Lancaster low water
bridge to Rudy (sometimes called the "Ribbit Run"). The class
II rapids in this stretch are long, twisting, and closely
spaced, making it one of the best stretches of beginner-
intermediate paddling in the state. Also, at most levels
surfing and play opportunities for advanced paddlers abound.
The first ledge below the Lancaster put-in is a great
surfing spot where paddlers tend to wear themselves out
before they even start the run. Waterfall Drop is just around
the corner, a good example of the surprisingly beautiful scenery
on this part of the creek. When a bluff bends the river back
to the left, watch for a series of fast rapids finishing with
"The Pourover". Powerful cross currents, rocks, and holes
make the rapid a challenging class II+ run at most levels and
kayakers can get vertical in the two pourover spots at lower
levels (between 2.9 and 3.3 feet is best for the upper
rock and 3.5 - 3.8 is good for the lower one). Railroad
Trestle #1 just downstream features very friendly surfing
waves and holes at all but the highest levels. Plenty more
good rapids follow: Five Eddies, Railroad Trestle #2, Rapid
Transit, Squirter's Eddy, and finally Canyon Rapids
(aka "Invisible Rock"). This last one is less than a half-mile
from the takeout in Rudy, and it features one of the
most difficult to see pourover rocks in the state. Most
of the action can be missed by staying far left, and the
run down the right side is for would-be heros only! Don't
let the "Bayou" in the name fool you - the Frog is as good a
class II whitewater run as you will find!

Galla Creek
Rating: III-IV _
TDCR: ????
Location: Pope Co., The close proximity to I-40 and 4 mi. shuttle
make this one of the easiest creek shuttles in Arkansas.
Go north off I-40 (exit 88) at Pottsville (just East of
Russellville) on Crow Mtn. Rd. (Hwy. 363). Proceed up the
mountain 2.3 mi. The Bridge is unmarked but would be hard
to miss. There is not a lot of parking so plan accordingly.
Take out at Galla Lake by going back down the mountain and
turning west on Hwy. 64 into Pottsville. Go 1 mi., then
turn north and follow Galla Park Rd. to the lake. The park
gates close at 4:30p.m. Alternative take out would require
a carry around the dam and a short paddle in the dam outflow
to I-40/Hwy.64. Galla Creek can be run in 1.5 to 2 hours
including shuttle.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Russellville East
Gradient: 92 fpm (last mile before lake drops 140 fpm)
Length: 3.15 mi. (last .75 mi on the lake)
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: No gauge. Generally would require at least 2.5 in. of rain in
Russellville. If there appears to be enough water at the
put-in, there should adequate water downstream because there
are several small branches that enter downstream.
Hazards: The major hazards are trees. Several of the rapids require
maneuvering thru trees in class III situations. Some of the
drops are semi-blind with slots. Deadfalls are common.
Description: Galla Cr. was first run in April 1992 by Charles Chevaillier
and Bob Silkensen and then again in May 1995 after a 4 inch rain
by David Wilbanks and Dale Barton of the Russellville area.
The second run was in November 1996 after a 2.8in. rain.
The total drop is 220 ft. The initial 2/3 mi. drops 60 ft.
and is mainly characterized by fast water through trees, but
the visibility downstream is fairly good. At one point the
creek bends left and under a tree which has grown from the
left bank onto a rock in the middle of the bend; portage on
the left. The next mile drops 140 ft and is very similar to
a smaller, steeper Richland Creek with trees. The canyon
gets noticeably deeper and several waterfalls and small
streams enter. It is difficult to believe that you are only
about a half mile from the interstate! There are several
class III rapids in this section and a couple of IV's. One
(Boof Lube) has a tricky class III entry, followed by a
tight line right through some trees, over a small hole, slide
left, and a quick 7 ft. boof right into poorly padded,
fast water (whew!). The bottom portion of the creek still has
several class III drops and a few require some must make
slot moves. The action only stops at the lake. Thanks
go to Dale Barton for the description of this great little
creek run!

Graves Cr.
Rating: III+ (IV+) _
TDCR: ????
Location: Pope County; From Hwy 7, take Hwy 164 to Twin Bridges
(Moore Outdoors), cross Big Piney, and turn right
on 1800 (Pilot Rock Road). Turn right again on 1800A.
When road changes from graded gravel to "4WD", continue down
hill to just past the first hairpin; park and drag boat
downhill about 1/2 mile going due West. Goal is the where
two forks of the creek join at about Elevation 790 feet. Two
options exist for take out; either continue down this same
road until you first see Graves Creek (take out #1), or
take out at Long Pool on the Big Piney (take out #2).
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Treat
Gradient: 106 fpm (not counting Big Piney)
Length: 1.9 mi (plus 5.4 miles if you go to Long Pool)
Season: RAIN
Gauge: Can't be gauged by comparison to Piney. Has been
run both with Piney at 4 ft and with Piney above 17 ft.
Look for about 1.5" or more of rain within the last 6 to 12
hours. Rain gage exists at Twin Bridges; can be accessed via
ACC Bulletin Board.
Hazards: numerous strainers, undercuts (especially in one small box
canyon)
Description: The lower section (below Take out #1) was probably
first run years ago by Kerry Moore, Dale Barton, and/or other
locals, and has been used by Kerry as an alternate put-in for
rescue work on the Big Piney run. The first known run of the
upper section was Nov. 5, 1994, by a small army consisting of
Paul Caldwell, Cowper Chadbourn, Nathan Kline, Chris Jones,
Jim McDaniel, Paul Newton (OC-1), Ted Smethers, and David
Wilbanks. This run is worth doing for the scenery alone,
with many beautiful waterfalls coming in from either side,
including a very spectacular one at "Amphitheater". The
gradient is generally evenly distributed along the
run, with one notable exception at "Amphitheater". Just
after you run the first 8 foot waterfall, beware
The next drop after this waterfall contains a hidden
shelf rock and a nasty undercut rock/bluff, and as of late
1995 had only been run one time at a lower level (by Nathan).
All boaters should be confident on steep class III+ water, or
you should opt for a run on the Piney instead. Thanks go to
Copwer Chadbourn for information on this run.

Location: Newton Co.; put in at NFR 1463 crossing 1.2 mi N. of
Fallsville on Hwy 21; take out at the Hwy 21 bridge over the
Buffalo R. at Boxley, AR
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Fallsville, Boxley
Gradient: 40 fpm
Length: 14 mi.
Season: RAIN
Gauge: 10 in airspace to 1.5 ft. over the low water bridge over the
Buffalo R. at Ponca AR. Call BOC at 1-800-221-5514 for a
reading. (Rating is a solid III+ at levels over 1 foot over
the Ponca bridge.) You can also predict the levels using
the Buffalo R. river and rain gauges which are linked below.
LINK BUFFALO NATIONAL R. GAUGES (UPDATED HOURLY)
Hazards: strainers, remoteness and length of run
Description: This is the major tributary to the upper Buffalo R. It
is possibly the ultimate Arkansas wilderness run. 14 miles of
nothing but you, the river, and the mountains. The rating
easily goes up several notches in high water. The remoteness
of the creek makes rescue a very difficult proposition, but
mistakes can easily result in damaged equipment or people.
Be sure you have lots of time to make it to the takeout.
It often takes more than six hours to run the 14 miles. One
particularly dangerous spot occurs about halfway down the run.
A class II rapid leads into an undercut cave on the left bank,
and a significant portion of the river disappears into this cave.
There have been some close calls at this spot where boaters
have been swept into the cave and gotten stuck on debris.
At high water this cave could be a killer. Watch for it,
and scout anything you can't see until you get past this
point. Make sure you have solid intermediate whitewater skills
and plenty of experience on other Ozark creeks before
attempting the Hailstone.

Hart Cr.
Rating: III-IV (V)
TDCR: 8785
Location: The take-out is at the popular Hwy 220 bridge over Lee Cr.
(the put-in for section 2 of Lee). To get to the put-in
take Hwy 220 south (the paved side) until you almost reach
the top of the hill. Turn off on the first major dirt road
to the left. This is the road that goes from Hwy. 220 to
Chester and Hwy. 71. Follow this road for approx. 4 mi. until
it parallels the Hart Cr. drainage. There is a large clear
cut on the left that is barely visible from the road. It is
easiest to hike down to the creek on the west side of
the clear cut (left if you are on the road facing the
creek). There are a few small turnouts on the side of the
road opposite the creek that are good for parking. Be
careful not to block any of the small dirt roads. Make sure
that you carry down near the clear cut area, because the
land there is owned by the USFS. All surrounding land is
private. Another way to determine the proper location is to
drive all the way to the first four way intersection. When
you get there, turn around and drive about a mile back
toward Lee before carrying down. The carry is a short, steep
brushwhack that will take about 15 min.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Rudy NE
Gradient: 200 fpm (1/2 mile @ 300 fpm)
Length: 4 mi. (counting 2.25 miles on Lee Cr.)
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Recent (within a few hours) and heavy (2+ inches) rains are
a must for a good run. There are two ways to try to estimate
the flow on Hart Cr. Neither is particularly accurate. Lee
Cr. should probably be reaching flood stage (about 12+ ft).
Also, Clear Cr. and its tributary McCaslin Br. near Chester
should be very big and muddy. The only way to really be sure
is to hike to the put-in. The put-in can look a little low and
you'll still have a good run. If you can't boat at all at the
put-in, the run will be too bony.
Hazards: barbed wire fence (2/3 mile into the run), severe undercuts,
boulder sieves, dangerous rapids, trees, trees, and more trees
Description: The creek was first run 2/27/97 by a small determined group
of paddlers including Noah Fraiser, Kevin Fendley, and
Bill Herring. The level for the first run was quite low,
but all rapids were successfully completed (with much
scooting and dragging in the first 1/2 mile). A second run
at a much higher level was made in January of 1998 by Bill
Herring and Noah Fraiser. The creek starts out as an
extremely small stream, even by Ozark standards. The first
3/4 mile consists of non-stop, straightforward class III-
action in a 10 to 15 ft. stream bed. Much of this stretch
is surprisingly clear of trees, but there are a few
nasty strainers so stay alert. Many times the creek is
tightly constricted (5 to 10 ft) for long stretches. This
is fast, heads-up boating with little chance of catching
eddies. Fortunately, the water is usually shallow and not
very pushy. About 2/3 mile into the run you will drop into
a very narrow bedrock sluice followed by a large island. Pull
out at the top of this island to carry across the barbed
wire strands at the end of the island. The current is fast
under this fence, and the approach is devoid of good
eddies, so be sure to get stopped in time. After this
point you are on private land, so treat the land with
respect (and please don't even think about cutting the
fence!). A short distance past the fence, a large
tributary enters from the right. The flow is doubled and
begins to get quite pushy. The first big class III below
this tributary (named Pacemaker) marks the start of the
hard stuff. In the next 1/2 mile all hell breaks loose as
the creek plunges continuously around, over, and through
large boulders as it drops 150 ft. After a brief warm up
you'll run into Hart Attack, a big class V jumble that
blocks all downstream visibility. This rapid has been run,
but the landing is extremely cluttered. If you choose to
run it, try to angle from left to right to avoid a
vertical pin on the left. The current pushes to the right
at the top of the drop, so use this to your advantage.
If you choose to walk it, drag up and over the left bank.
Hart Attack is immediately followed by a series of tricky
ledges, nicknamed Defibrillator, that lead into a blind,
class IV- sluice called Nitro. This one is impressive at
almost any water level, but, if the water is high, it will
be the most memorable rapid on the creek. The creek is
funneled down a narrow chute on the left until it plunges
six feet into a shallow pool. It's hard to stay in control
comming out of Nitro, but you need to regain your composure
quickly because you'll be flushed through some class III
ledges below it before the creek slows down. The next 1/2
mile is non-stop class III+ action. You may find yourself
moving too fast in the narrow stream with no way to slow
down. Scout as frequently as you can to avoid getting
buried under one of the undercuts or strainers that occur
frequently in this stretch. The individual rapids are not
too nasty, but with a lot of water, it's hard to slow down
and run the complex class III drops one at a time. After
you come out of the hairy stuff, you still need to be on
your toes for the 1/2 mile paddle to Lee Cr. The creek splits
in a few places, but staying to the right should keep you
in the clearer part of the stream. Once you hit Lee Cr.,
you're in for some big water. Watch for some big hydraulics
(particularly a class V river-wide ledge just below the
Hart Cr. confluence that can be skirted on the far left) and
one very bad willow jungle before you reach the 220 bridge.
Hart is a tough run, but it is mercifully short. Still, give
yourself three or more hours to allow for a lot of time to
be consumed by scouting, portaging, and unpinning boats.
Also, take extra gear and a saw if you can. The gorge is
extremely hard on equipment (a broken paddle resulted from
the first run) as well as bodies. Obviously this is an
experts-only creek run, and even the experts would be well
advised to check it out on foot before attempting it in a
boat.

Haw Creek
Rating: II+-III _
TDCR: 4450
Location: Put in below Bowman creek or anywhere along road. Bowman
creek comes into Haw creek about 2.5 miles from Haw creek
campground. It enters on river right. You can see Bowman
creek on the left as you drive up highway 123. Take out-
Haw creek campground crossing, or any spot along the creek.
Topo Quad(s): Rosetta, Ft. Douglas
Gradient: 48 fpm
Length: 2.5 mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Piney, Richland, Hailstone, little piney should all be in
flood. There should be over 3 inches of rain at Deer in the
past 48 hrs for a good run. At the campground, the crossing
marks should have water one ft from the top for an optimal
run. Above that, the creek will get pushier, faster and
less room for error exists. You can see if there’s enough
water by just looking at the creek.
Hazards: log jams, blind drops, ledges and holes to avoid
Description: This run would be good for boaters comfortable on Falling
Water Cr. or Lower Richland. It is a small creek with
good water volume, good ferrying, eddying hopping, and
water reading skills are a must. When all the creeks are
in flood, Haw Cr. is a good choice for intermediate
boaters. It is short, close to the road, and can be
scouted easily. Normally a class II+ to III run, if
the creek is really pumping, then all bets are off.
Across the road from Bowman creek, you can brush crash
to a nice little ledge to put in. The creek could be run
father up, but it gets tighter and bonier. Below the
put-in are a couple of ledges that should be run to
the right. Most of the rapids are best run far right or
far left. There are a number of ledges with holes below
them. Soon you'll find a double ledge that should be
run to the left over the first and then ferried right
over the second. Below this, there is a sharp ledge
across the entire creek. Run it to the far right. You
will see a shale rock sticking up on to a tree in the
water below the ledge. We ran to the right of it.
There is another hole below that can be skirted on far
right or left. Left seems to have less brush. By now the
road will be rising to river right with a noticeable
cliff face. There is a waterfall on the right off of
the shale bluff. Enter the rapid here to the left and work
down. After the water fall, there is a class II+ drop that
should be scouted. The creek is split by a tree with a
ledge. Run to the left, follow the tongue, and move right
to avoid the flat rock below. There is some more good stuff
below, but eventually you’ll get to a flat spot where the
creek splits into two channels. You should also see the
road again. Take the right channel, work down and go under
the bridge to the right. There is another ledge and hole below
the bridge - it can be run to the far right. The channel squeezes
in again here and there’s willows, so be on your toes.
A significant double drop/hole known as "Small Juju"
can be run to the far right. Go right before the boulder
in the middle of the channel and hug the right bank. Or
run left into the holes if you dare! From this
point, it’s about 50 yds to the confluence of Gee Creek.
Gee creek should double the volume of the water. From here
on out, it rocks and rolls! A few yards below Gee creek,
there’s a good wave series with a hole at the bottom. Run
to the left to avoid the hole. You should see the
campground crossing soon below. Below the campground crossing
there’s a long rapid that looks like a flume. You
should see the campground to your right below this. Haw
Creek Falls is next. At an optimal level, the drops can be
run to the right to avoid the second drop. At higher
levels, who knows? Once you come around the left bend,
you will be entering "Big Juju" (IV? V?). This rapid is a
sight to behold! There’s a sharp diagonal ledge
at the top, immediately followed by a mushroom rock below
it. The most obvious route looks like river left but
there is a tree with a root stob sticking out in the middle
of that line. Far right looks better, but any line is iffy!
You can scout this rapid from the road as there is
a campsite with a pulloff next to it. Above Big Juju,
there are few eddies, but you can recognize it
when the current picks up, the channel straightens and
constricts, and you pass a triangular rock in the middle
of the creek. Good Luck! Below this, the creek follows
the road and then ducks below a bridge before entering
the Piney. Beware of the bridge! Thanks to T. Yamashita
for information on this run!

West Fork Of Horsehead Cr.
Rating: III-IV+
TDCR: 8897
Location: To reach the take-out take Hwy 164 North from I-40
(exit 47) and drive approx. 3 miles north to Horsehead Lake.
Cross over Horsehead Cr. and take the next left which will
take you around the East side of the lake. Bear to your
left (stay near the lake) and you'll eventually come to
a low water slab that is under water (hopefully!). This
is the Main Fork of Horsehead Cr. Since you can't drive
across this creek (assuming the water is high enough to
boat), park here and drag your boat 1/2 mile over to this
spot from the West Fork of Horsehead when you take out.  
 Or you can paddle out on the lake if you want to. It's about
50/50 on effort either way. To get to the put-in, go back
around the lake (the way you came) and take a right on 164.
Once you cross over Horsehead Cr., take the second dirt road
to the right (North). Bear right at the only major intersection
and you'll start heading way uphill until you get to the
small community of White Oak. At White Oak the road T's
into County Road 30. Turn right (North) on CR 30 and
follow it for a few miles through Oak Grove to Batson.
Take the first road to the right (South) just past the
Batson church. Follow this road for 3/4 mile until you
see a small trailer in the corner of a field on your right.
Turn right on the small road just past this trailer. This
is labeled FR 1445A on Ozark National Forest maps. Bear
left on this road past a road that splits off to the right.
After another 1/8 mile, you'll see a small turnout on the
right that you can park at. Park there and brushwhack
1/4 mile and 300 vertical feet down to the creek. Bringing
some climbing ropes and harnesses is not a bad idea at all.
You're aiming for aprox. elevation 1500 feet on the creek.
Good luck!
Topo Quad(s): N/A
Gradient: 160 fpm avg. (1 mi @ 420 fpm)
Length: 5 mi
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Very heavy rains (3+ inches) in the Clarksville and Ozark
areas are needed to bring the creek up to a runnable level.
The creek is best gauged by driving to the Middle Fork of
Horsehead Cr. (the takeout). The ends of the concrete slab
should be at least a few inches under water for a good run.
A gauge reading of 9 feet or higher on Spadra Cr. may also be
an indication of enough water on Horsehead Cr.
Hazards: Numerous trees, numerous undercut rocks and ledges
(especially at the Teacup), and fast, blind approaches to
big waterfalls
Description: This run was first explored by Steve "Dog"
Robertson, Dave "The Grey Ghost" Reid, and Bill
"Fish" Herring on 5/13/1999. The character of
this run can be summed up in one word: waterfalls. There
are many of them of all shapes and sizes on the creek, and
all of them are runnable under the right conditions. The
run starts off with an incredibly steep brushwhack
downhill to reach the put-in on the edge of the National
Forest boundary. Once you reach the bottom (not an easy
task) you'll find an old roadbed that leads up away from
the creek on the left side. From this put-in, the creek
slides and tumbles through a nearly solid sheet of rock as
it descends at over 400 fpm through a very narrow, steep-walled
gorge. The beauty of the gorge is incredible, but getting out
of it requires ropes and climbing skills in many places. The
rapids are almost all low angle slides with some rocks
stuck in them. In fact the whole creek is really just a
natural waterslide. While this is fun in the lesser
rapids, it creates long, eddy-less approaches to the
bigger drops. None of the major drops can be seen clearly
before you are committed to them. Very frequent scouting
is an absolute nescessity, and a good hike beforehand at
low levels is a must as well. The bigger drops start
with Gooseneck, a long sliding approach followed by a 10
foot drop into a very small grotto. The hydraulic at the
base of the last plunge may be inescapable at high water.
Lots of fast action and trees bring you to another large
sluice/fall combination which is a lot of fun unless there
is a tree down in it. A scout past the next major horizon
line reveals one of the most dangerous rapids on the run.
The "Teacup O' Death" consists of three
consecutive four foot ledges with the second ledge emptying
into a huge undercut. The portage is easiest on the right
bank. If you put in just past the Teacup, you'll be running
a fast runnout stretch that features some jagged looking
undercut bluffs. Just past these a big feeder pours in
from the right. Stop immediately at this feeder and scout
ahead to the next big fall (it's almost a certainty that
you'll get swept over the fall if you get within 50 yards
of it). This fall drops about 15 feet into a shallow pool.
The water right below the lip of the drop is quite
shallow, but the center of the pool is a few feet deep.
It's a very iffy drop, and the portage to the pool below
it requires a rappel (be sure to bring a good rope!). Test
the pool very carefully if you're thinking about running
this one. A lot of fast, sliding drops follow this big
fall. Only run when you're sure you can cleanly catch the
next eddy. Flying Dog Falls, a potentially bruising 20+
footer, is somewhere in this stretch, and if you get
closer than 50 yards to it you'll be running it blind. You
can't see the horizon line from the start of the entrance
rapid, so be very careful! Flying Dog has a 5 foot deep
pool, and it will tend to launch you into a nearly flat
boof because of the small step right above the big drop.
Is it worse to try to pencil down into really shallow
water, or to land flat and potentially compress your
spinal column? If you don't want to try to find the answer
to that question there's a really easy portage just to the
left of the fall. There are a bunch of fun rapids below
Flying Dog as well as a few bad trees. After another half
mile or so, you'll pick up a lot more volume from some
feeders and the gradient will ease off somewhat. The
balance of the run is very fast and fun class II+ to III
water. There are several nice ledges and slides on the
lower part of the creek, and a few undercut spots that can
take your head off if you get too complacent. If you take
out on the lake, be sure not to paddle over the spillway
at the far end. This monster has been run at certain
levels, but it's definitely not a healthy thing to do.
West Horsehead is obviously a potentially dangerous creek
that requires a very high level of commitment. It's
incredibly difficult to get out of the gorge once you're
in it. Portages and scouting are best done in many places
with the help of good climbing ropes. At medium to high
levels, the countless sluices, slides and falls don't
provide many eddies at all. There aren't that many really bad
drops, but the few that are there are huge and very dangerous.
No matter how good you are, you'll be swept into them
if you don't know exactly where they are. Be very sure you know
what you're getting into before you carry down to the creek!

Hurricane Cr. (Franklin Co.)
Rating: II+
TDCR: 2341
Location: Franklin Co.; Take Hwy. 215 north from I-40 near Mulberry
until you get to Shores Lake. Go south of Shores L. and
put-in at low water bridge below the dam. Take out 1 mile
downstream on gravel road on river right or float to
Hwy. 215 take out for Mulberry R.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Bidville, Cravens, Mountainburg SE
Gradient: 40 fpm
Length: 1 mi. (or 9 mi. if you float the Mulberry too)
Season: RAIN
Gauge: The Mulberry R. gauge (501-324-5150) should be over 6 ft.
Hazards: no major ones
Description: Hurricane Cr. is a good warmup or chaser for Spirits
Cr. that is located just to the east. It is also a good
run to catch in the afternoons after a busy work day. The
rapids are nearly continuous class II, and the first one
is a 3-4 ft. ledge that can be surfed. There are several good
surfing opportunities, and the end of the run provides good
eddies for squirting. If you're only going one mile, you can
walk the shuttle in 15 minutes and run the creek again. Just
make sure you don't miss the take out; the next one is eight
miles downstream!

Hurricane Cr. (Newton & Pope Co.)
Rating: II+-III _
TDCR: 3345
Location: Take out is reached from I-40 by taking Hwy 7 north to
Pelsor. Go west on Hwy 123 for about 10 or 11 miles. Take a
right on a dirt road just before crossing the Ft. Douglas
Bridge over the Big Piney Creek. Go about 1.5 miles to the
Hurricane Creek take out at a low water crossing. (This is
just upstream from the confluence with the Big Piney.) Put
in is reached by back tracking on Hwy 123 to Hwy 7. Go
north 7 to 9 miles. Look for the "Who'd A Thought It" gift
shop on the left. Take the dirt road just to the left of
the gift shop. Soon you will come to a fork. Veer right
and continue down hill 3 or 4 miles. After you get to the
bottom of the valley you will come to another fork.
Veer right for another 1/2 mile to the put on Cub Creek
just a few hundred yards upstream of Hurricane Cr.
Topo Quad(s): Chancel, Ft. Douglas
Gradient: ?? fpm
Length: 9 mi.?
Season: RAIN
Gauge: Reportedly this run can be done when the Piney is at 5
feet. It can certainly be done when the Piney is about 6
feet and Richland Cr. is running at least 3 feet.
6 - 7 feet on the Piney is better and 4 feet on Richland
would be even better.
Hazards: Strainers are the main hazard. Often there are
downed trees that must be portaged or avoided.
Description: This stream is a good choice for intermediate to
advanced paddlers who may not be interested in Richland Cr.
or harder runs. The first few miles are similar to the Big
Piney and the second 1/2 is more like Falling Water Creek
or maybe even lower Richland. The scenery is A+;
waterfalls entering the creek are numerous! Strainers are
the most obvious hazard to contend with and there are usually
a few downed trees that need to be portaged. The pace is good
for the first mile or so with challenging class II rapids. The
creek then slows down for a few miles before the mountains
squeeze the creek bed into a good class III jewel. Watch
for "Uh Oh"! rapid a nice class III boulder garden about 3
miles upstream of the takeout. The line is somewhat
difficult to see until you enter the drop. It is
reminiscent of some of the drops on Section III of the
Chattooga. ("Uh Oh" was the loud response from Gordon
Kumpuris when boat scouting it for the first time.) Run
it left to right. Thanks go to Gordon Kumpuris for
information about this great Ozark run!

Hazards: trees, pour over hydraulics at high levels - the last
hydraulic on S2 can be sticky at higher levels
Description: S1 is a good class II run for intermediate boaters.
Beware of downed trees in this section. S2 is a good run for
beginners. Some of the best action on S2 comes just downstream
of the put-in at a series of standing waves created by ledge drops.

Location: The put in is located at a bridge over the river just
behind the "Hogeye Mall", a convienience store near
the intersection of Hwy 265 and
Hwy 156 (aka Hogeye Rd.). From Fayetteville,
take 265 to Hogeye either from the Cato Springs
exit or from the Greenland I-540 exit. Hwy 156 can
be accessed from the West Fork exit as well. The main
takeout is reached by driving north (toward Fayetteville)
on Hwy 265 from the Hogeye Mall. The second marked county
road on the left takes you to an old iron bridge across the
river (this road is labeled as Orr Rd. on Google
Maps. The first county road left (labeled Kinzer Rd)
will also take you to a slab across the river to cut off
a mile of the trip or to serve as a low water put-in,
but you miss some great rapids either way.
Topo Quad(s): West Fork, Strickler
Gradient: 14 fpm
Length: 4 mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: The run takes a lot of rain to get it going and it drops
out pretty quickly. It runs when Fall Creek is running, so
the USGS gauge for Baron Fork at Dutch Mills
may be a good predictor if rain is widespread (look for
over 3.5 feet and rising). Also check the Illinois R. at Savoy
gauge. 5 to 6 feet on this gauge and
rising fast can be a good sign. However there are 25+ miles
and a ton of watershed between Hogeye and Savoy, so the
correlation is not really that good.
Hazards: Trees, strainers, and some barbed wire near the creek.
Description: When West Fork gets pounded with rain, it's not a bad idea
to drive the 15 minutes from Fayetteville to Hogeye to
check out this great little class II+ run. If the creek
looks like it can be boated without scraping at the put-in
near Hogeye Mall, it's good to go. But it gets better and
better with more water! When the gravel bars under the
iron bridge at the takeout are under and the rapid
upstream of the bridge looks like two big riverwide ledge
holes, hang on to your hat! Though the gradient appears
somewhat anemic, the run tends to pool up and then drop
over ledges, making for terrific surfing at higher levels.
At optimal levels, there are six to seven terrific surfing
spots, though finding good eddies gets more problematic as
the water rises. When the water's really cooking, it's
mostly "catch on the fly" time on some honest-to-god BIG
waves. At the slab bridge (possible takeout) a long ledgy
section produces some nice spin holes, and another half
mile downstream, a sloped ledge generates a powerful hole
for spins and tricks. The rapid just above the iron bridge
is the biggest drop, and at certain water levels, it's
holes can be difficult to exit. However, if you swim there
(and a few have!), just get your boat to the right bank at
the bridge and crawl up to your vehicle! Beginners should
watch out for some tricky maneuvering through trees in a
few places, and, needless to say, it's no place for
beginners when the water is high.

Jordan Creek
Rating: III+ _
TDCR: ????
Location: Put-in is .5 miles south of Cane Hill on Hwy 45. It
will be obvious when one sees an old mill sluice on the
left (east) side of the drainage (that can be an optional
put-in) and on the right (west) you will see a dirt road
that parallels Jordan Creek. There is a roadside pullover
there with plenty of parking. You can also scout the meat
of the run using both the dirt road and Hwy 45. The first
drops of the run are along the dirt road, then on the other
side of the creek - less than 100 yards down the highway -
there is an old mill complete with huge steel grist wheel
that is right on top of some of the best drops. It is marked
on the topo maps as a roadside pullover. The take-out is
reached by going south on Hwy 45 4.5 miles. You will see
a road to your right, and two bridges should be visible
(within 1/4 mile from Hwy 45), a new one and an old arched
bridge made of concrete (this is an optional take-out if
you want to extend the run another mile and a half). Continue
across this bridge 1.9 miles until you see the third road
on the right, follow it a short distance down to a low-water
crossing - the take-out.
Topo Quad(s): Lincoln
Gradient: 55 fpm
Length: 4 mi.
Season: RAIN
Gauge: Baron Fork at Dutch Mills should be 5.0 minimum. The
correlation should be fairly good because it is only 4.5
miles upstream from the guage, however there are two creeks
that flow in upstream of the guage, so take that in
consideration and check you precipitation estimates before
you go.
Hazards: Logs, log jams, barbed wire. There are several barbed wire
fences that parallel the creek and could create a hazard
after a flood, plus at least one cattle fence that
needs to be treated with caution.  
 Description: First known descent occured on January, 5 2005 by
Steve "dog" Robertson, Steve Runnles, Wood Harlan, and
Paul. The first part of the run consists of a mile of
III+ and has all the characteristics of a small steep
creek. Below the first mile it becomes a II-III run that
is pastoral, and this is where logs are a concern. The
first mile is extremely accessible via the highway.
The creek is in a geographical "gray" area for whitewater,
it is accesible by road, there is an accurate gauge
correlation and it not too far from West Cedar, which
provides a backup plan in case the water in Jordan is too
low. Boaters who can handle creeks like Spirits and
Falling Water should be able to paddle Jordan Cr., and
like those creeks, easy road accesibility makes this one
very creeker-friendly. Thanks to Steve Robertson for
information on this run!

Kings River
Rating: III+ _
TDCR: 5657
Location: Madison Co.; Put in at Dripping Springs low water bridge
north of Hwy. 16 just east of Boston. Take out at
Hwy. 74 bridge west of Kingston.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Weathers, Kingston
Gradient: Steep at the start and non-existent at the end...
Length: 11 mi
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: There is a gauge on the downstream side of the Dripping Springs
bridge at the put-in. It is graduated in 1/10 inch increments.
Minimum is 1.0 ft., optimum from 1.5 to 2.5 ft., and if
water is running over the bridge the run is too high. The
Upper Kings is usually runnable when other area streams, such
as the Mulberry and White Rivers, are in flood.
LINK TO USGS GAUGE
Hazards: strainers, tight fast-paced rapids
Description: This run is not to be confused with the pastoral Kings R.
that Tom Kennon describes in his book "Ozark Whitewater." This is the Upper Kings that Kennon briefly mentions. A serious
class III+ run, the Upper Kings warms up for the first mile
until Kings Falls (III), a sheer drop of over six feet, is
reached. Below the falls the gradient picks up and several
class III to III+ rapids are encountered. God's Kitchen (III),
Red Rock Sluice (IV), Jester (III), Wicked Game (III+), and
Kings Throne (III+) are some of the more intense rapids. The
toughest of these is Red Rock Sluice. This one got it's name
from the red marks made by David Thrasher's open canoe
during the first descent of the creek. Scout and/or portage it
on the left. Take time to enjoy this steep, exciting stretch
because the last six miles down to the Hwy. 74 bridge are as
flat as a pancake. This character building paddle is the
price of admission for the great whitewater above. DO NOT
be tempted to shorten the run by taking out above Hwy. 74.
The land is all private, and the landowners have threatened
to tow any vehicles parked near the creek! All boaters should
have solid intermediate whitewater skills and advanced flat
water skills for this run. Seriously, be confident on fast
class III-IV water or don't mess with this part of the Kings.
Thanks to Shelby Johnson for information on this run.

Lee Cr.
Rating: II+ (S1: II-III, S2: II+)
TDCR: 3232
Location: Crawford Co.;
S1: Put in south of Devil's Den Park on NFR 702 and take out
at Hwy 220 bridge.
S2: Put in at the new Hwy 220 bridge (which replaced the classic
"steel bridge" in 2000. There's a dirt road on the river
left side upstream of the bridge that leads to a parking
area. Take out at the great new NFS take out by going
south on Hwy 200 from the bridge about 200 yards and then
turning right onto Lee Creek Community Rd. (gravel). Go
about 1/4 mile and follow the signs, turning right to
drive to the parking area for the take out. You can
drive right to the river to pick up boats, but please
park in the designated area. This is an easy shuttle
to walk if you don't want to mess with two cars.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Strickler, Rudy NE
Gradient: 15 fpm
Length: S1: 10 mi., S2: 1.5 mi.
Season: FALL, SPRING
Gauge: The USGS gauge at Short Oklahoma should be more than 4.5
feet to scrape down. Above 5.0 the play is fairly good.
Above 6.0 it's much better! S2 can be fun up to very high
levels for advanced boaters, but most folks will think
it's getting pretty crazy at anything over 8 feet or so.
LINK TO USGS GAUGE
Hazards: heavy strainers in S1, powerful hole at Buck and Flush at high
levels
Description: S2 is one of the most popular play runs in the area.
Fun can be found at almost any runnable level. The gradient is
not great, but the short run seems to be filled with action.
At higher levels waves and holes are abundant. After a longish
pool, the first drop is fast and powerful - and studded with
rocks at lower levels. It doesn't have any well known name,
but the rest do. Football Field Rapids is a 100 yard long,
wide series of ledges. This one is usually shallow with some
surf holes on the right and the hard to catch Touchdown Wave at
the end. At very high levels (>12 feet) the entire rapid is
filled with large irregular waves and wave-holes! The next drop
is El Horrendo, which used to be less than half it's present
width. A tree washed out on the left bank in the mid 90's and
the result was a much weaker, straightforward ledge at regular
levels. After a pool comes Surfing Ledges (also known by other
names), where holes can be surfed, and enders can be had on the
river right at levels of about 9 feet. After another pool,
Buck-N-Flush is waiting. This rapid was long feared in the 90's
for it's grabby, punishing hole at levels of 7+ feet. Testing
oneself in Buck-N-Flush hole was sort of a right of passage for
Northwest Arkansas kayakers for a decade, and many a bold boater
tangled with the hole and lost, providing an opportunity to test
PFD's and throw ropes. While not terminal (swimmers generally
flushed out almost immediately), this spot was maybe the most
infamous stopper in the state. But after the record flooding
of June 2000, a gravel bar downstream of the main ledge was
formed, the pool level was raised and the result was a kinder
and gentler hole. At least for a while. One of these days
another flood could relocate some gravel and surprise some
boaters once again. In any case, the main part of the hole
can be avoided by staying to the left and riding down the
seam of green water. After Buck-N-Flush waves continue until
the takeout at high levels. Look for rock steps up the bank
at the end of the long rock shelf on river left to take out.
S1 is a different run entirely. It has a few nice rapids,
but the play is not nearly as good as the lower section.
Also there is one of the worst strainer jungles in the Ozarks
just upstream of the Blackburn Cr. confluence. Due to the
ugly hazards and lack of nice drops, S1 is not often run.
S2 is a good run for agressive beginners, but S1 is much
more dangerous and boaters running that stretch should
have experience negotiating strainers and holes.

Left Hand Prong (N. Fork Illinois Bayou)
Rating: II-IV _
TDCR: ????
Location: Put-in: Take Hwy 16 East from Pelsor appox. 1.5 miles and
take an old logging road to the right (South). Follow the road
as far as possible and drag down the hill the confluence of
the first two forks (Elevation 1500). Reach the take-out at
the Victor bridge over the North Fork of the Illinois Bayou
by taking Victor Road from Hwy 7 near the Freeman Springs
Cemetery.
Topo Quad(s): Sand Gap
Gradient: 140 fpm (300+ fpm max)
Length: 8 mi. (2 mi. on LHP)
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Gage at Richland Campground should to be above 6 or headed
that way. Look for 1.5" or more rain at the Deer and Ben
Hur rain gages, at the BNR Data Page. Rain must have fallen
within the last 6 to 12 hours.
Hazards: Undercut ledges and rocks, overhanging branches,
strainers, waterfalls.
Description: First known descent was November 1, 1996. By Cowper
Chadbourn, Chris Anderson, Robin Booth, Walter & Gayle
Felton (OC-2), Lane Gorman, Lance Jones, Nate Kline and
Robert Orr. The creek starts out small until joining with
the Right Hand Prong and Cedar Creek. Most drops are tight
continuous class II-III in nature, but a few IVs are
scattered in for good measure. Scenery is very excellent!
Shortly below the put-in is a tight complex slot drop with
some pin potential. About 0.5 miles downstream is a poorly
padded 5-6 ft ledge with a piton rock waiting. A hard
landing is likely even with a good boof. The highlight of
the creek comes shortly when the creek narrows to 3-4 feet
on a shallow bedrock slide. The slide ends in an 8 ft drop
known as "The Spout" into a horseshoe shaped pool. The
Right Hand Prong doubles the flow and some fun shoals and
slides await near the confluence with Cedar Creek. There
is a 4wd road to the right at Boyd Cemetery, if needed.
But fun class II-III water with lots of surfing lasts for
the next 3 miles to the Victor bridge. Like other
micro-volume creeks, meaningful ratings are difficult to
establish on the accepted International scale. At lower
levels, the creek may seem like a very technical class
III, with much rock bashing, scraping, and some portages.
At higher levels, several rapids are expected to become
solid class V. Be familiar with the particular hazards
of small Ozark creeks before attempting this run. Thanks
to Lance Jones for information on this creek!

Little Mill Creek
Rating: III-IV
TDCR: 5676
Location: The take-out is the same as is used for the Mill creek
take-out on the bottom end of the Mulberry River. It is
on a road that turns east off of Hwy. 215 north of the
I-40 Mulberry exit. The turn is about 3 miles north of the
freeway and just north of the Mill Cr. bridge on Hwy. 215
(this is the only large creek crossing between I-40
and the town of Fern). Follow this dirt road for about
1/4 mile to a low water slab and park off the road
on the river right side. Several put-ins are possible, but
none are really easy. Be very careful trying to cross
the creek when the water is up, but if you can do it,
you can follow the dirt road on the east side of the gorge.
Just past the last house on the left (back in the woods),
where the road is very near the creek, you can scramble
down the bluff with your boat to access at Slap Happy Pappy
rapid at the top of the lower gorge. This is a good
low water option, but it is not an easy climb down!
Another couple of miles or so up the road, there is
an old logging road that heads west toward the creek
into an old clearcut area. The turn onto this road is
greater than 90 degrees if you're heading north (it's
a "Y" intersection from the other direction). You'll
probably want to drive only a little way down this road
(the USFS tries to block it from time to time). Park
and walk down the old road and bear downhill to the
creek. You'll cut through the clearcut and down
through a bluff line. When you intersect the creek
you are at Fern Gulley - either put in here if there
is enough water or cross and continue down a short
distance to the confluence with the Middle Fork. If
the water is too high to cross the low water slab at the
takeout (which it often is), you can drive back to 215
and then north to Fern. When 215 turns east at Fern,
go until you pass an A-frame house on the right. Take
the next right on a very good geavel road. This is
the same road that crosses the creek at the takeout.
Follow it for a mile or so to the "Y" with the
old logging road that leads to the put-in
described above.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Mountainburg SE
Gradient: 120 fpm (first mile @ 180 fpm)
Length: 2.75 mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: The Mulberry should be high and rain farily recent to
run the creek. The best way to gauge it is at the
takeout slab. An inch or so of water over this slab
is absolute zero level for a run down the lower
gorge section (the upper part is too low). With
6 inches of water over the slab in the middle,
the gorge will be good and the upper creek bony.
A foot or more is a good level for the entire creek.
If the creek is spreading into the parking area,
it will be very pushy and dangerous - it has been
run with several feet of water over the slab, but
that can't be recommended! The USGS Mulberry R. at
Mulberry gauge is not a great indicator for Little Mill
since it is upstream of the Mill Cr. confluence. However
a level of 8 feet or more on the Mulberry gauge is a
good sign that Little Mill could be there. Also,
the USGS rain gauge at Mulberry is close to Little
Mill's watershed, so a rain of 2 inches or more
in a short time is also a good indicator.
Hazards: many trees and strainers, large drops, undercut rocks
Description: First run on 2/21/97 by Steve Robertson, Zen Boulden,
Kent Peetz, and Richard Haler, this creek is a real gem.
The creek starts at the confluence of Fern Gulley
(the East Fork) and the Middle Fork of Little Mill (both
are steeper creek runs when the water is high). Just
downstream, the West Fork enters to add more volume.
The first major rapid is Gollum's Hole, a class III
drop around a blind right hand corner, with a spooky
series of caves in a sandstone bluff at the bottom. At
really high levels, this rapid and the next one, Stone
Ground (III) have some mean holes that must be punched.
The next two miles of the creek consists of almost
constant rapids, though at optimal levels none are
tougher than class III. Trees are often a major hazard
in these two miles, so stay alert and be ready to
eddy out and portage! The creek suddenly opens up and
changes character as Slap Happy Pappy Sluice (III-)
is encountered. This is usually a scape down a wide
shoal unless the water is extremely high. The creek
narrows again, but now has a solid bedrock bottom. This
is the lower gorge - the main attraction! After some
smaller drops, the horizon line of Lacerator (III+)
comes into view. Don't flip here or you may find out
how it got its name! The next drop is The Gash, a class
IV at optimal levels. The eddies below Lacerator are
hard to catch, so it may be a good idea to scout both
of these drops if you're new to the creek. The Gash
starts with a move to the right around a big mid-stream
rock and then a short slide into a turbulent sluice.
This is kayak pinball at it's finest! Strong cross
currents tend to try to push you into the jagged looking
rock wall on the right near the bottom. You can
try to stay left, but failure may result in a flip
and The Gash is not a good place to be out of control!
An alternate plan is to go with the flow and play the
bank shot off of the reaction pillow against the wall.
This is a gutsy looking move, but with good boat control
and a solid brace it can result is a smooth ride
to the bottom. After The Gash is a ledge with a hole
that demands respect at higher levels and then the
Undercut From Hell. This is a rocky drop that feeds
into a jagged and deeply undercut wall on the left side.
Though it can be snuck to the far right, a scout and/or
portage here is prudent. After a bit more water,
the last major rapid can be recognized from the large
horizon line on river left. This is Love Shack Falls,
and it is the biggest drop on the creek. Love Shack
has been run on the left over the big angled ledge,
but it is a shallow landing and can result in a bruising.
The more frequently run line is down the entrance
rapid on the right, hang the corner, and try to get
to the middle of the waterfall for a boof. The base of
this 6-7 footer is rocky, and a long boat could
vertically pin here if the nose plunges deep. Failure
to boof has resulted in the occasional elbow injury.
Boats can be carried back up on far river left
for another run here, and The Gash is also a good
candidate for multiple runs if you don't mind tempting
fate! The gorge ends at Love Shack and the rapids are
tree-choked class II to the takeout 1/4 mile down.
Little Mill is a great steep creek run in the southern
Ozarks. It's maybe a half-notch tougher than
nearby Spirits Cr. which may be a good alternative
for those not sure about tackling the more hazardous
rapids on Little Mill. If you're a Fayetteville or
Fort Smith boater, this creek is a good reason to
not drive all the way to Richland! Thanks go to
Steve Robertson for information on this one.

Little Mill Cr., West Fork
Rating: III+ (IV) _
TDCR: ????
Location: the put-in road is off Hwy 215 4 miles from the Mill Creek
bridge. Take-out is the same as the Little Mill take-out.
An optional put-in may be accessed 2.7 miles from Mill Creek
Bridge but is 4x4 only and may not get you to the creek
without a hard hike.
Topo Quad(s): Mounatinburg SW
Gradient: 228 fpm
Length: 1.6 mi. (plus 2.75 mi on Little Mill Cr.)
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: The Mulberry should be huge (8 feet) and rising on the USGS
gauge at Mulberry to catch the West Fork of Little Mill.
Little Mill Cr. should almost be covering all of the concrete
of the slab at the takeout. You can also check Fern Gulley -
if it is at a runnable level, the West Fork should be too.
Hazards: continuous rapids, undercuts, and of course a bunch
of logs!
Description: This creek was first run on January 4, 2005
by Steve "Dog" Robertson, Steve Runnles and Sammy Wellborn.
It is 1.6 miles of nearly continuous class III with a
couple of drops besides the big one at the bottom that
approach class IV in difficulty. The big drop comes
right before the confluence with Little Mill, and is
formed by a boulder pile. There is an undercut on river
right, but most of the current blows by it. At high water
the whole run might be bumped up to class IV. This is
a great alternate run for those not yet ready to handle
the more serious hazards on Fern Gulley or Mormon Creek.
Those comfortable on Little Mill and Spirits Cr. could
make the step up to this creek when the water is high in
the area - just watch out for the fast pace of drops and
the high potential for logs blocking the streambed.
The run is WAY fun, has plenty of challenging whitewater,
and there is no hike in. What more can you ask for? Oh
yeah, how about three miles of Little Mill Creek running
high to boot! Thanks to Steve Robertson for information
on this and the entire Little Mill drainage!

Little Mulberry Cr. (A.K.A. Microwave Run)
Rating: III-IV _
TDCR: 5657
Location: Madison Co.; Put in is reached by turning on a dirt road
to the south two miles east of Red Star on Hwy. 16. The
road is located just below a large microwave tower. Follow
this road till it ends or until the going gets too rough
for your vehicle. Then hike down to the creek. Take out
at the Spoke Plant low water bridge 5 miles downstream.
IMPORTANT NOTE: a landowner on the creek above Spoke Plant
has expressed concern with paddlers boating this stretch, which
runs through her property and does not want anyone to boat the
creek at this time. Boaters are encouraged to respect the
landowner's wishes. If you need to contact the landowner, please

Topo Quad(s): Boston
Gradient: 60-80 fpm
Length: 5 mi
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: None. Can be run only after heavy local rains.
Hazards: fast action, strainers, and class III+ rapids
Description: This run was pioneered by Shelby Johnson and Ryan
Johnson in Spring of 1994. The first mile and a half
packs quite a punch with rapids like Initiator (III), a
6 ft. waterfall, and OWS (Ozark Wall Slammer) (III+). Several
class III drops are then followed by Fish Ladder (IV), a
congested boulder sieve that remains unrun due to low water
conditions on the first descent. Several class III rapids
follow until the paddler reaches Plank Rapid (III). Here the
paddler must eddy out and remove a plank bridge before running
the rapid. Be sure to replace the plank after completing
this fun drop. Several class II-III rapids follow until the
takeout. Strainers are a fact of life on small Ozark creeks,
so watch out for downed trees that can easily block the
creek. Only solid class IV boaters should attempt this
fast paced and challenging run. Thanks to Shelby Johnson
for information on this run.

Long Branch (EFLB)
Rating: III-V _
TDCR: ????
Location: Newton Co.; Go North on CR 28 from Deer toward Wayton and
Parthenon. This road takes you past the Alum Cove recreation area.
Continue for 2 miles North past the rec. area and park on the side
of the road. Drag West down the through the woods aiming for the
confluence of the top two forks. (Elevation 1800) The creek is small
and basically a shallow bedrock shoal for first 0.25 miles. Reach the
take-out by continuing North to the community of Wayton from the put-in.
Turn left (West) on CR 96 at the Wayton Baptist Church. Go 2.3 miles and
turn left (South) on CR 95. Snow cemetery should be on the right.
Continue ~2.5 miles down the mountain to the community of Murray. Be sure
to check out the scenery on the way down. Especially the small but tall
waterfall above the first creek crossing. At the bottom of the hill,
there are a couple of houses on the right then a triangle intersection. To
the left, Willis Park is beside the creek at the low-water bridge and there
will probably be standing water in the field. Park at the community
building next to the park at the intersection. Be sure to thank any
locals and leave a donation for this facility. (Elevation 1065)
Topo Quad(s): Murray
Gradient: 285 fpm (450 fpm for last .4 miles on Long Branch)
Length: 2 miles on Long Branch followed by 4.5 miles on East Fork Little Buffalo
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Gauge at Richland Campground should to be above 6 or headed that way.
Look for 1.5" or more rain at the Deer and Mockingbird Hill and Murray
rain gages, at the BNR Data Page. Rain must have fallen within the last
6 to 12 hours.
Hazards: Undercut ledges and rocks, overhanging branches, strainers,
waterfalls. Very tight in places (pinning hazards). Watch your
head at 'Duck and Cover'. The last 0.5 miles of the creek is
essentially one long steep complex rapid.
Description: First known descent was March 19, 2002 by Lance Jones,
Cowper Chadbourn, Greg Churan, Heath Day, Scott Hanshaw, Bryan Hughbanks, Mike
Jacobs, Jeremy Kasouf, Nate Kline, Matt May, John McCoy, Jason Mellor, Mike
Oglesby and Ray Skinner. The creek starts out very narrow with a 0.2+ mile
long shoal. Shortly after crossing an ATV trail a third fork enters from the
left. Immediately below this fork is the first set of drops. The first horizon
line is a steep fast slide dropping 12-15 ft followed shortly by a 6-8 ft
waterfall (run on left or right) followed shortly by a 20-ft steep fast slide
into a small pool. Leave the pool far right in a narrow slide, ramp up on the
right bank to avoid slamming the boulder on river left and ride the flume out
the bottom. After these first drops, the creek becomes boulder drops. The next
horizon line is an interesting double drop named 'Duck and Cover'. The first
4-ft drop is under an overhanging rock into a sticky boiling hole. The second
part offers a nasty slot with pin/piton potential on river left or shallow
slide down river right. Lots more nice class III/IV for the next mile with
some nice drops like "Baby Zwick's" and 'Switchback'. Haunt Hollow enters from
river right to add a little more water before the meat of the lower gorge begins.
The bottom gorge offers very steep banks and 450+ ft/mile for a third mile.
Big complex boulder drops with holes, pin potential and undercuts. The portages
are worse! The lower gorge consists back to back drops with small eddys
scattered about. The beginning is a boof from the right aiming left. Go
left of the first rock and boof off the second back to the right. This
avoids the two holes to the right of the rocks and lines up for the final
slot on the right. Small eddys on each side offer a break before dropping
over a 3-ft ledge preferably right. The left side below the ledge feeds a
boiling eddy which pillows on a rock blocking most of the exit. One more
small eddy and through a 5-ft slot drop, eddy left. Boof center over the small
hump into the next eddy on river right. Pin potential in the river right
tongue beside the hump. Below this river right eddy is the 'Particle Separator'.
Name has dual meaning. First, the rapid requires a 3-ft boof to the left over
the broken ledge aiming for a boat wide slot on river left beside the 'separator'
rock and over an 8-ft ledge at the bottom. Going right of the separator rock
will take you into a nasty looking notch. Will probably flush though but it
may be a bumpy ride. Second, it separates the boaters from the walkers
(The portage is high and tough on either bank.) A couple eddys are available
below the ledge before entering the 'Long Branch Saloon'. Majority of
the flow funnels left toward a house size boulder. Enter the door to the
left onto the tongue beside the pillow and get ready for a punch in the
face from the hole at the bottom of the 10-ft drop. At high water this
hole could become nasty as the creek is constricted between the large
boulder on the left, the cliff on the right and water pouring straight
down into the deep pool. Out of the pool and work between some rocks
and back to the right. Boof off the 5-ft ledge onto a sluice/slide.
Follow the flume around the sharp left hand turn, avoid the left bank
and eddy right. The main rapid is next. The gorge ends in a bang with
'Freeride'. This rapid drops 45-50 ft over 100 yards. A long complex
solid class V rapid starting with 3 boulder slot moves followed by a 5-ft
boof into a small eddy on the left. There is no stopping after this eddy
until the pool at the bottom. The creek turns sharply right over a cluttered
4-ft rock pile. Best line is middle to right, ride the bow high on the
right bank as it turns back to the left. Negotiate a route through some
trash rocks down the right side as the creek turns back to the left. Line
up for an 8-ft boof onto a slide. Hit the boof right with left angle to
avoid the right shelf rock and the hole and undercut wall on the left. Once
on the slide, quick acceleration takes over to the final 10+ foot waterfall.
Punch through the curler pushing you right on the approach to the waterfall.
You want to be left to avoid the large boulder on the bottom right side
of the pool. Just around the corner from the pool is the East Fork Little
Buffalo. The creek enters ~ 0.5 miles below Johnson's Falls so get ready
for 4.5 miles of big water through the meat of the EFLB at flood! This is
class IV+ big water with juicy holes, swirlies and crosscurrents. Like other
micro-volume creeks, meaningful ratings are difficult to establish on the
accepted International scale. At lower levels, the creek will seem like a
very technical Class III, with much rock bashing, scraping, and some
portages. At higher levels, several rapids are solid Class V. Thanks go

Long Devils Fork Cr.
Rating: III-V _
TDCR: 8786
Location: Newton Co.; Put in is just south of Ketcherside Mtn on
Lurton Quad; start near where map shows elevation 2059 on
road, follow faint remains of old logging road SE downhill
then turning to NE and continuing down ridge to creek junction
just below elev. 1600. Drag from main road is about 0.7 mi.
to put-in. Take-out is at Richland Creek Campground.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Lurton, Moore
Gradient: 180 fpm (not counting Richland)
Length: 2.5 mi. plus 1.5 mi. on Richland
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Water should be nearly flush with Richland Campground bridge
or above 6 ft on the ACC Bulletin Board gauge. Also, look for
1.5" or more rain at the Deer and Ben Hur rain gages, as
posted on the ACC Bulletin Board. Rain must have fallen
within the last 6 to 12 hours for a run. At very high levels,
expect a solid class V run for 4 miles.
Hazards: difficult rapids, overhanging branches, strainers,
waterfalls.
Description: First known run was April 30, 1995, by Cowper
Chadbourn, Chris Jones, and Nathan Kline, with the
exception of Long Devils Falls (river right side of Twin
Falls) which was first run April 11, 1995 by Cowper Chadbourn
(followed shortly by all others who were participating in the
first run of Big Devils Fork). In early May, 1995, Lance
Jones made the first OC-1 run of this stretch of whitewater
with some portages). Dale Barton claimed the first OC-1 run
of Long Devils Falls about this same time. This run is very
similar to Big Devils, but has generally cleaner drops, longer
slides, and fewer undercuts. This run has what has to be one
of the longest (but not the steepest!) rock slides in Arkansas;
expect terminal velocity if water is sufficient to prevent
scraping! Just below the first big waterfall (8 to 10 feet),
you will encounter "The Devil's Playground". Look for the
runnable channel down the river left side. If you choose to
run the 16 to 18' waterfall at Twin Falls, run left of center
and try to maintain good speed to launch well into the pool
below. Several pitons have occurred due to low speed, right of
center runs of this falls. Also, the portage around the falls
may be more hazardous than the run. At lower levels,
consider tying your throw rope to your boat and letting the
boat run the falls without you. All drops on Long Devils have
been run, but many could be rough for an inverted boater.
After you leave Devils Fork, the run down Richland (IV+ at
these levels) gives you little opportunity to relax! This
run is for expert level boaters only. The room for error
on the run is very, very small, and mistakes will be punished!
A flooded run on Falling Water Cr. would probably be a more
sane option that tackling this creek before you're ready.
Thanks go to Cowper Chadbourn for the description of this run.

Meadow Creek
Rating: III+
TDCR: 5567
Location: From Leslie, AR on Hwy 65 go 7 miles east on Hwy 66 to
Oxley. Turn right on paved county road and travel 2 miles
to end of pavement. Turn left and follow winding county
road 3 miles to a T-intersection. Turn left and go 0.5 mile
to the Flag intersection. Turn left and go 1.5 miles to a
low-water bridge where the road makes a 90 degree right
turn. This is the put-in. Return to the Flag intersection
and continue straight (this would be a right turn in the
put-in directions). About 3 miles past Flag at the bottom
of the mountain you will come to a flooded Suck Hollow
Creek crossing. The take-out is at the mouth of this creek  
 as it flows into Meadow Creek 100 yards below the road. If
you miss the mouth of Suck Hollow Branch while paddling you
can take-out at a low-water bridge 0.5 mile further down
the creek and walk the county road 0.5 mile back to the
vehicle. If you decide to cross this creek you can drive
0.5 mile further to the low-water bridge and take-out
there. The bridge will probably have 3-4 ft of water over
it so keep in mind if the creeks are still rising you may
become stranded between two flooded creeks. In addition, as
you have probably figured out by now, your are a long way
from nowhere.
Topo Quad(s): Fox, Oxley
Gradient: 55 fpm
Length: 5.5 mi.
Season: Rain
Gauge: The Middle Fork of the Little Red should be at least 12 ft
or more in Shirley. This gauge however has its limits
because the Little Red is a large river and several miles
below its headwaters when it gets to Shirley. Meadow Creek
does not have a significant impact on the Little Red so the
gauge is approximate. There should be at least 1 ft. of
water over the put-in bridge for a good run. The Tick Creek
tributary to Meadow Creek is tiny at the put-in, but it
meets two other tributaries and nearly triples in size
within 200 yards of the put-in.
Hazards: waterfalls, undercuts, strainers, trees
Description: The first two miles on Tick Creek are chocked full of
willow lined chutes and fast II+ water. At about two miles
the paddler reaches Squeeze-the-Tick (III) where the creek
turns sharply left and drops about 15 ft. over 20 yards
through a very narrow willow lined chute. The approach to
Squeeze is sudden and the decision to run the left chute
must be made quickly. Don't run the right chute because of
a poorly placed tree growing in the middle of your path.
About 1/4 mile farther Tick Creek meets Jimmy's Creek
entering from river left and the two become Meadow Creek.
The next mile contains fast II+ water with some nice
boulder dodging. A small bluff on river right signals the
arrival of Walk-on-the-Wild-Slide (II-III+). The Slide is
river wide and drops 15 ft. or more over about 15 yards.
At a level of 1 ft. over the put-in bridge the Slide
should be run river left. A Walk in the name implies the
slide should be ported at lower levels for the sake of
boat preservation. At higher levels the Slide a wild
cascade with two river wide holes on the way down and a
slap-you-in-the-face stopper at the bottom. The bottom
hole provides nice surfing at lower levels. About 1/4 mile
below the Slide hides a 15 yard long undercut ledge on
river right. This could be dangerous at lower levels so
pay close attention. Another 1/2 mile later the roaring of
Meadow Creek Falls (III+) announces the arrival of a nice
scouting trail on river right. The Falls section drops
approximately 25-30 ft. over 150 yards and cannot be
scouted adequately from your boat. The only line available
to run the sheer 8 foot drop is about 15 feet from river
right. The paddler needs plenty of speed and a good boof
to avoid the nasty hydraulic below. A bad boof will result
in a Class IV+ nightmare. I have seen these falls without
water and they are no place to be inverted or swimming.
Paddle aggressively and catch an eddy before washing
through the rest of the falls. From the pool below the
falls you paddle through a wide slot on river right and
blast through Greener Pastures Ahead (III). Greener
Pastures is the last drop in the Falls section. It's a
narrow, but straight forward chute on river left that
drops about 12 ft. over 10-15 yards. Watch for brush
hanging out over the chute from the bluff on river left.
In higher water Greener Pastures Ahead may be run on river
right which ends with a 5 ft. sheer drop. Looking back up
through the Falls section provides a very nice picture of
just how scenic whitewater paddling can be. The remaining
2 miles provide little time to relax as the fast II+ water
continues to wind through narrow slots lined with willows
and dotted with trees. If you plan to take-out at the
mouth of Suck Hollow Branch it is a large tributary on
river right as Meadow Creek makes a hard left turn about 1
1/2 miles below the falls. Meadow Creek was first run on
January 6, 1998 by Randall Gammill and Nick Hansen of
Springfield, Missouri. It compares well with many other
intermediate runs in the Ozarks. It has good length,
gradient, scenery and doesn't require a flood for a good
level.

Micro Cr.
Rating: III
TDCR: 5570
Location: Crawford Co.; Put in and take out 1/10 mi. below Lee Cr.
put in (S2) at Hwy. 220 bridge. You can boat or walk down
to the creek which enters Lee on river right as Lee bends
sharply to the left.
Topo Quad(s): Rudy NE
Gradient: ??? fpm (it's very, very steep and short)
Length: 0.1 mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Lee Cr. should be flooded (> 12 ft.) This one can only be
boated immediately after extremely heavy rainfall.
Hazards: several trees standing in the creek and very tight, bony
drops.
Description: If you are lucky enough to catch Lee Cr. an hour or
less after a big rain, you may want to look at this
tiny creek with no name. The entire run consists of two
drops. The first is a 6-7 ft. class III+ with a narrow
margin for error and a very shallow landing. After a short
lesson in tree dodging the second drop of about 5 ft. is
encountered. The creek never gets more than 10 ft. wide, so
maneuvering and/or eddy catching is a joke. This is a good
side trip during a run on a very flooded Lee Cr. Just make
sure you are ready to pay the price in lost skin if you screw
up on this one!

Middle Fork of Little Mill Cr.
Rating: III-IV
TDCR: 6786
Location: Traveling south on Hwy. 215 from Fern, go one mile then take
a left (east) on a gravel road (if you go 100 yards past it there is
a yellow two-story house indicating you've gone too far). Follow
this road for about 200 yards until it turns to the south and
begins to go uphill where the road widens and there is
plenty of room to park. Park you car here, and carry down to the
put-in, a short 100-150 yards due east. This is the confluence of
the middle fork and two tributaries; slides and waterfalls
abound! The take-out is found by going south on 215 from Fern,
turning left at the Ozark National Forest sign, and then taking the first
right. This will follow a finger ridge, then a steep slope down to
the mouth of the Middle Fork Gorge (this is also the put-in for Little
Mill Cr.). From the highway to the take-out is 1 mile. This is
definitely a road for 4WD's only! If the Middle Fork is up then this
take-out will be an adventure in itself, class IV driving at least!
Topo Quad(s): Mountainburg SE
Gradient: 187 fpm
Length: 1.5 mi.
Season: Flood
Gauge: Creeks such as Spirits and others larger creeks like
Hurricane must be in full flood. If Mill Creek appears to be
bank-full at the Mill Creek Bridge then it is ready. If it
just looks runnable then it may be too low. Two or more
inches of very recent rain are a must for this creek.
Hazards: undercut rocks, downed trees, strainers, undercut grottos
Description: The defining characteristic of the Middle Fork is the
exposed sandstone bedrock that literally forms a sandstone
sluice for a large part of this section. This sluice
varies from 6 to 20 feet in width and drops over shale and
sandstone falls that are at times partially blocked by
sandstone boulders. There are at least two drops over
boulders into grottos that need to be scouted due to the
possibility of vertical pins or lodging under undercut
ledges. It is a unique run in that civilization (I-40 is
less than 8 miles away) is close, but the extreme relief
so effectively isolates the paddler that one feels as
though it is a wilderness run. To not do the rest of
Little Mill would be silly indeed, especially when one
considers the condition of the access road to reach the
take out. Middle Fork of Little Mill is a tough creek that
gives the paddler very little room to maneuver. You had
better be a very competent class IV boater, or you may find out
just how extreme the relief is as you are hiking out of the
gorge. As with all super-narrow Ozark creeks, trees can be
a huge factor in the difficulty of the run. Deadfalls can
easily create some overnight class V traps on the Middle Fork,
so scout ahead as often as possible. Thanks go to Steve Roberston,
the pioneer of the Little Mill/Mill drainages, for information
on this terrific run.

Description: This run contains many good class II+ rapids, and
the action is pleasantly continuous. Walter Diggs Rapid
is encountered halfway into the run, and it is a long

to portage. The willow strainers are unrelenting on this
run. If you don't have great boat control in class II water,
this isn't the run for you.

Mill Creek
Rating: II-III+
TDCR: 4555
Location: You can put in up in Devil's Canyon, but this is not recommended
for three reasons. One is that the put-in is a long drag into a gorge
that is hard enough to access without having a boat to drag. The second
is that Devil's Canyon Branch of Mill Cr. is usually too small and dry to
paddle, necessitating an even longer drag down to the main branch of
Mill Cr. The last reason is the multitude of deadfalls that require long
portages on the upper creek. The few good rapids in Devil's Canyon are
not worth the effort. A better put-in can be reached by going about a
mile north of the Hwy 215 bridge over Mill Cr. You'll see the National
Forest sign marking the forest boundary. Within the next mile there is a
private inholding consisting of a big rectangular area on the left side of
the road (the inholding is clearly marked on the Ozark National Forest Map).
This was orignally owned by a church (still marked on the map) and
there is a building that used to serve as the church but is now a private
residence. Keep going past this building and look for a gravel road on the
left. Go past this road and take the next small road on the left. Drive
as far as you can and then park and walk down to the creek. These directions
are still very rough, so follow them at your own risk. The take-out is
the easy to access Hwy 215 bridge over Mill Cr. a few miles north of I-40
near Mulberry. If you want to access in Devil's Canyon, you can follow
Hwy. 215 north from the take-out until you see a small dirt road on the
left with a red post near it. Follow this road through a clear-cut
until you come to a posted gate. Go right at this gate until you
see the dark red National Forest Boundary marks on some trees.
Park anywhere and start hiking left off of the road toward the
canyon.
Topo Quad(s): Fern, Mountainburg SE
Gradient: 86 fpm
Length: 7 mi. from Devil's Canyon to Hwy 215
Season: RAIN
Gauge: If the rapid above the 215 bridge appears to be runnable
then it should be at a runnable level. The run is at the
bottom of the creek, so the appearance of this rapid is a
direct reflection of the conditions upstream. The higher
the water the better the ride over the slide drops upstream.
The Mulberry should probably be around 5 ft. or more, but
it is not a great gauge for Mill Cr. if rains are localized.
Hazards: strainers, undercut ledges and boulders
Description: This is a strange, but cool Ozark creek. If you are crazy enough
to carry down into one of the steepest canyons in the Ozarks, Devil's
Canyon, you'll be rewarded with a very small creek that has some good
drops but little water. This creek merges with the main branch of Mill
Cr. about 1/2 mile downstream, and until this confluence there is rarely
enough water to boat. The first two miles of the creek are fairly
uneventful, with constant easy class II drops and a couple of tougher
rapids. Then the next mile is a portage, with bunches of trees
dropped into the creek by the tornado that ravaged Fort Smith in 1996.
It almost looks as if the area has been clearcut and the trees left to
rot. The only bright side to this is that it gives you lots of time
to admire the interesting bluffs that rise up to the left of the creek.
After a long, ugly walk, the trees end, and fortunately they don't
return. This is where the second access point is - a much better place
to put in. After this point the creek gets quite interesting as it cuts
down through several layers of sandstone and shale, creating numerous
small falls and slides. The biggest of these is Charlie's Slide
which can be recognized by a car sized boulder that sits dead center
just upstream of the slide. The creek drops 10 to 15 feet over a very
cool low-angle side drop. The rapids for the next three miles are
predominantly easy class III drops that are nearly continuous. Stay
alert for a couple of potentially nasty undercuts that can sneak up
on you if you get too complacent. At high water the surfing is
about as good as it gets in the Ozarks. True eastern style boating
in your backyard. Not as hard as it's tributary Little Mill Cr.,
Mill Cr. has a bigger watershed and will be runnable when other
creeks in the area are not going. The first known kayak run of Mill
creek was in 4/98 by Charlie "No Paddle" Stotts, Steve "Treedini"
Robertson, and Bill "Pickled" Herring, a truly crazy bunch of boaters.

Mormon Creek
Rating: IV (IV+)
TDCR: 7895
Location: Drive north on Hwy 215 from I-40 (the Mulberry exit) about
five miles to the bridge over Mill Cr. This is the takeout.
To reach the put-in, go north from the Mill Cr. bridge
on Hwy 215 approximately 3 miles. There you will see an Ozark
National Forest sign on the right. Go past this sign and look
for the first well-maintained road on the left (it should be
fairly obvious, since the others "roads" are old logging roads
and skitter trails). Follow this road until it dead ends at a
berm. There is a trail that has been beat down to the left of
the bern, and a big 4WD truck can make it down, but it is only
a 1/3 mile drag down to the creek, so why not park at the top.
Topo Quad(s): Mountainburg SE
Gradient: 330 fpm
Length: 1.5 mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Mormon Cr. is tiny. It doesn't need much water to make
a good run, but the level will not hold long at all. It
can generally be paddled for only a couple of hours follwing
heavy downpours of rain. Look for 2+" in under 2 hours to
pump the creek up. The Mulberry should be flooded, probably
8 feet or higher on the Mulberry gauge. A visual check should
be made at the Mill Cr. bridge (the take-out). Mill Creek
should be bank-full or better, meaning ALL of the rocks in
the rapid above the bridge should be covered and the water
should be very muddy. If you get to the put-in and there
looks like there's enough water to scrape down in a boat,
it's probably a good level. If you're not scraping down
the first long slide, the level is extremely high and
hazardous.
Hazards: The 20+ foot drop of Mammer Jammer is certainly a
serious hazard! The entire creek is fast and shallow,
so it is nowhere to be upside down in your boat! Trees
can be (and usually are) a serious threat. Often, you
may not have any eddies to stop in for long distances,
and with the extremely narrow streambed, trees can
easily block the entire creek. Scouting ahead from every
you can get in eddy is a very good idea, and be prepared
to hit a tree somewhere on the run.
Description: Mormon Creek was first run February 15, 2001, by
Steve "Dog" Robertson and Micah "Nick" Adams. Mormon creek
does not have a name on any maps, but the closest landmark
is an old Latter Day Saints church, and thus the name.
It begins as a small sandstone ditch that is almost
laughable when one considers this a "runnable" creek,
however it is not to be taken lightly. The put-in starts
one of the longest slides in the Ozarks, at least
1/2 mile long, with numerous 3 to 6 foot ledges to
generate interest. There aren't any major tributaries to
Mormon Cr., but hundreds of little creeks cascading down
the sandstone/shale bluffs gradually contribute to
the water level and volume picks up steadily as you go
downstream. Several bigger ledges signal the beginning
of the gorge, so when you encounter these, it's time
to strap on your seat belt. At high water, the creek
will come at you incredibly fast with few eddies to
stop in. The first major drop, "UH", is a nice "sluice-
with-rocks" type drop of about 6 to 8 feet. Pull out to
scout this and the next rapids too, since it is followed
immediately by "OH", a 12-15' near vertical slide with a
shallow landing. Recover quickly because at the end of the
pool (25 yards) below OH is "Snake Eyes", a potentially
nasty class IV drop. This whole area is reminicent of a
tea-cup style series of drops, dropping a total of 15-20
feet onto a sandstone slide that ends in a pool. The rapid
gets its name from the large boulder that looks like a dice
(showing the number two) lodged in the left side of the
drop. At low water, the drop should be run from the left
at a 45 degree angle to the right; at high water run it
anyway you can! Now, you're in the heart of the gorge,
consisting of a narrow, winding closed in sandstone
trough surrounded by undercut sandstone and shale walls.
The big drops are surrounded by huge undercut bluffs
that look like a backdrop to an Anasazi village. After
Snake Eyes there is constant class III until the biggest
drop is encountered: the Mammer Jammmer. This class IV+
monster is a 20-25' drop that begins as a vertical 10'
drop before landing on a 60 degree angle slide. At
low water levels the majority of water flows over the
right side of the drop producing a vertical drop that
crashes onto a rock shelf. The drop is not safely
runnable on the right line at any level! The optimal
route is the far left where the water has worn a "V" in
the lip of the drop, followed by a steep slide to the
bottom. No mater what line is used, boofing the drop is
not a good idea at all. Mammer Jammer is follwed by one
a good class III drop called "Sycamore". This one consists
of a double drop connected by a slide. Watch out for the
sycamore tree at the bottom of the first drop; the only
route shoots you directly into the giant undercut roots
of the Sycmore. If you don't get pinned on the roots
you're off to a nice ride down the slide/drop. This is
followed by one of the most beautiful corridors of
hanging plants/waterfalls in the Ozarks. The rapid under
this natural wonder is named "Bobsled", since it feels
like running a bobsled track through an ethereal setting.
After the big drops above, the rest of the run is cake,
with lots of fast class III drops to paddle. When you
get to Mill Cr., it will be big and bad, like a high
water run on the Hailstone with huge waves. There are
also many surfing opportunities on the paddle out, with
dozens of Lee Cr. style surfing holes and waves. You'll
probably be completely worn out when you reach the
take-out bridge. Mormon is a tiny little creek that
does some big things when it comes to slides and
waterfalls. Like Horsehead Cr. and Rattlesnake Hollow,
the biggest challenge for a paddler will be stopping.  
 If the water level is very high at all, you may not
be able to stop if there is a tree down in the creek,
or you may be swept over a drop you'd rather not run.
Make sure you're comfortable paddling this type of
sub-micro steep creek before you put on.

Mystery Cr. (aka Sandy Springs Hollow)
Rating: IV+ (V) _
TDCR: ????
Location: Newton Co.; To reach the put-in go south from
Deer on Hwy 16 then turn right just past Deer Church on
outskirts of town. After about 2 miles, turn right again on
smaller dirt road descending a hill. Go straight to hit
creek directly, or turn left and follow road that parallels
creek until it ends. For directions to take-out, see EFLB
description.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Deer, Swain, Murray
Gradient: 190 fpm (1/2 mi @ 320 fpm)
Length: 9.8 mi. (this includes 8 miles on normal EFLB run)
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Must have mucho big rains for this one. The EFLB takeout
should be roaring.
Hazards: difficult rapids, strainers, waterfalls
Description: The designation "Mystery Creek" for this extreme upper
section of the EFLB began as an inside joke because when this
run was first being considered, the name of the creek was not
divulged even to close friends until the day of the run.
It is often called "Sandy Springs Hollow" these days,
since that's the name of the small hollow at the put-in.
It is believed that the first run putting in at
elevation 1840 ft occurred on November 14, 1993. The
first descent party included David Bibbs, Don Calaway,
Cowper Chadbourn, Charles Chevaillier, Bill Keathley,
Jim McDaniel, Ted Smethers, and Gil Wooten, all in kayaks.
An early put in is strongly advised. The first descent
ended well after dark, leading to interesting conversations
with locals and forcing some late night hiking along the roads
that parallel the lower portion of the EFLB run. Due to
the gradient and tiny watershed, water levels can fall before
you complete the upper section. The creek starts out with
some fast but easy slides. A class III ledge adds some
excitement before the creek is choked by boulders into
a much more serious rapid. At lower water, pins are
likely here and for the next half mile or so. At higher
water, a downed tree will be life threatening in the
extremely high gradient. The highlight of the run
is "Rooster's Two Step", named for the 3 ft step above
the 12 ft waterfall, first run by David Bibbs, AKA "The Rooster".  
 The approach is a blind curve to the left with one potential
eddy on the right side of the curve. If you boat around the
corner, hang on tight! After the "Rooster" the gradient is
serious and the rocks are big and often ugly. Several
bad sieves appear at low levels, making for mandatory
portages. Higher water opens things up, but it can be
hard to slow down and a flip will result in a serious
beating. When the main EFLB stem comes in from the right,
the gradient backs off, but with the added flow, there
are several spots with sycamores that present serious
hazards. Scout anything you can't see until you reach
the normal EFLB put in. The EFLB will be big and brawny
at these levels - possibly the wildest part of your day!
Sandy Springs is as difficult a steep creek as the Ozarks
has to offer and it requires a much greater skill level
than the EFLB run itself does. It rates right up there
with the hardest Ozark hair runs. If there's any doubt
put in on the EFLB. Thanks go to Cowper Chadbourn for
information on the creek!

Osage Cr.
Rating: III-IV
TDCR: 7666
Location: The put-in is located just north of Compton, AR in the
northwest corner of Newton Co. Take Hwy. 43 north from
Compton about 1/2 mile and take the first dirt road to the
left. There is a sign for an iron works place at the turn
off. The put-in bridge is about 1/2 mile down this. ASK FOR
PERMISSION to park near the bridge. The owners of the house
near the bridge are extremely nice, and they generally don't
mind boaters parking there if they ask to do so. To reach the
take-out bridge, go across the creek and take a right.
You'll climb a hill and go about 2 miles before taking
another right. Go about 3 miles to the small burg of Delmar
and take another right at the intersection. You'll cross
a small low water slab and go about one more mile to a
small bridge across Osage. Park near the bridge and don't
block the road.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Ponca, Osage NE
Gradient: 80 fpm (first 2 miles @ 130 fpm)
Length: 6 mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Osage is probably runnable when the Buffalo R. is about six
inches or more over the Ponca low water bridge, but the watersheds
are not very close, so Osage can be up when the upper Buffalo isn't
that high. The best place to gauge the stream is at the put-in.
If the first ledge below the bridge has water across most of the
ledge (between the big bush and the left bank) then the run is
good to go. If the first ledge is wall-to-wall muddy water and
the hole there looks really bad, the run through the gorge will
be extremely dangerous, sporting some of the worst keepers in
the state. You can also predict the levels using the Buffalo R.
river and rain gauges which are linked below. The Compton rain
gauge is in the Osage Cr. watershed, and it will usually
take an inch-an-hour rate of rain to bring the creek up.
LINK BUFFALO NATIONAL R. GAUGES (UPDATED HOURLY)
Hazards: big drops, undercuts, boulder sieves, hydraulics,
strainers, a fence in the last two miles
Description: Osage Cr. is a gem of an Ozark creek run. With a
short shuttle, easy access, a good watershed, A+ scenery, and
a 2 mile gorge boxed in by bluffs and chock full of class
III+ rapids, what's not to love? The first attempts
at running the creek were made in the late 1970's
by some of the BOC crew who were bored with the
Hailstone, and it was re-explored in April of 1997 by Bill
Herring, Howell Cox, and Jim Jernigan when all rapids were
run. This run is tougher than the average gradient would seem
to indicate. You know you're not dealing with the average
Ozark creek when you see the put-in. The run starts off
with a bang by dropping over a big rapid called Starting
Gun 15 yards below the bridge. This seven foot class III
fall will give you some idea of what is comming up
downstream. If this rapid gives you pause, don't venture
into the gorge below. It only gets tougher as you go down.
Another 40 yards brings you to Old Mill Falls, an eight
foot sheer plunge over an old dam. The landing is fairly
shallow, but it is easy to boof the drop on the right. For
the next 1/8 mile the creek tries to lull you to sleep
with some tight class II+ drops. When the drops start
picking up steam a little, the first class IV drop comes
into view. Bottleneck is a straight shot down the middle
of a churning sluice. The entrance rapid is class III, and
there is little room to stop before you go into the
maelstrom below. The line is obvious and not too hard to
make, just don't get upside down - there are several nasty
rocks under the surface. A very blind and tight class III+
drop follows Bottleneck and then the next class IV is reached.
Howler is a complex drop which requires some tricky
maneuvering to reach the final slot drops. The bottom drop
is split: the right has a rooster tail in the middle and
the left has a chance for a vertical pin. Howler
definitely warrants some careful scouting or maybe a
portage, both of which are best done on river right. After
several back to back class III to III+ drops, you come to
a long rapid that looks like a good place for a scout. Get
out on the right bank and walk down to take a look at the
biggest rapid on the run, Magic Mushroom (aka Moon Landing).
The Mushroom starts off with a long class III+ entrance which
dumps out onto a sloping shelf. With few good eddies to
catch, the creek screams down the shelf for about 30 yards.
At the end of this shelf the creek is confined between sheer
rock walls on either side and it drops about seven feet onto
another shelf. At moderate levels, most of the water is
channeled over a sloping ledge to the left. The water
banks off the left wall and pushes to the right below the
drop into a huge, slightly undercut boulder. The slide below
the big drop continues for over 50 yards around the corner. A
huge mushroom shaped rock overhangs the stream on the left
below the drop, providing for some of the strangest
scenery in the Ozarks. At most levels the Mushroom is a
long class IV drop, but at really high levels the combination
of the tricky entrance and the thundering main falls may
push it to class V difficulty. Scouting and portaging here
can be very difficult, but a scout is needed. It is
best scouted on the right, but the best portage route is
on the left, up and over the bluff and back down at the
end of the rapid. After the Mushroom, the creek drops
through myriad class III and III+ drops. At least two of
these cannot be navigated completely at lower levels. One has
a good looking entrance only to wash out into a boulder
sieve. Scout anything that you can't clearly see in this
section. Another nice class III+ drop is encountered near a
dramatic double cascade comming in on river right. Several more
class III's lead up to the final class IV drop. Switchback is
a powerful "S" turn compressed into the space of just a few
yards. It may not be as bad as it first appears, but a mistake
can result in a dangerous pin on the numerous rocks. Be confident
of making the required move or take the easy portage to the
left. Below Switchback the action slows down a bit, but several
good class III's remain. With the added flow from dozens of
tributaries, some of these contain some fairly sticky hydraulics,
so don't become too complacent. Finally the gorge recedes and
the rapids moderate to continuous class II+ for the last few miles.
There are still many bad strainers and one badly placed
wire fence to negotiate, so stay on your toes until you get
to the takeout bridge. If you tackle Osage Cr., be sure that
you have solid class IV boating skills. Even at lower levels,
the creek can be pushy and it is incredibly blind from the
cockpit of a kayak. The rapids are fast, powerful, and very
rocky, making the penalties for mistakes quite high. At higher
levels the rapids grow exponentially in power and danger. With
enough water to make the first hydraulic really bad, the gorge
is transformed into a very pushy, blind class IV+ run. Runs
of the creek often produce broken paddles, side pins, vertical
pins, lost skin, and bruised egos.

Possum Walk Cr.
Rating: IV-V (P)
TDCR: 8966
Location: To reach the put-in go 0.25 miles North from Drasco
(intersection of Hwy 5/25 and 92) on Hwy 5/25. Continue
North on Five Mile Road 1.75 miles to the first bridge.
Please park on the South side of the bridge. To reach the
take-out, go approximately 6 miles West from Drasco on
Hwy 92 turn North on Hwy 263. Go 1.5 miles and park at
the Public Access on the North side of the bridge over
Greers Ferry Lake.
Topo Quad(s): Drasco and Prim
Gradient: 100 fpm (3/4 mile at 200+ fpm)
Length: 2.4 mi (plus a few miles on Racoon and Beech Fork Creeks)
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: No official gauge. Look for 1.5" or more rain in the area.
Rain must have fallen within the last 6 to 12 hours. If the
bottom bar on the white water-fence at the put-in bridge is
partially underwater, it's a definite run. It should really
look fairly low at the put-in for a good level. If there's
water filling most of the streambed under the bridge, the
gorge will be extremely dangerous, and waiting for the water
level to drop may be the only good option.
Hazards: Undercut ledges and rocks, overhanging branches, strainers.
Very tight in places (some very nasty pinning hazards).
"Possum Hole" is a portage at higher water.
Description: First known descent was January 22, 1999 by Randall
Gammill, Lance Jones, Chris Anderson, Cowper Chadbourn,
Bill Herring, Steve Robertson, Zack Smith and Billy
Williams. Don't let the 100 fpm gradient fool you, that's
for the full 2.5 miles of the creek. The first 3/4 mile is
only 25 fpm. The meat of the run has a 3/4 mile section at
200 fpm, within lies a 1/4 mile section at 270 fpm and a
maximum gradient around 310 fpm. The first 0.75 miles
consists of a flat water warm up with a few riffles,
followed by a couple of actual small rapids. Then the
first notable drop: a little straight forward slide over
some smooth boulders. Now the meat begins. The next drop
is the "Possum Pinch", fast current that is pinched into a
slot just a few inches wider than a boat. The pool below
the pinch marks the start of the "big five".
The first one, "Road Kill" is a short complex drop of about
10-12 feet, which ends in a nasty slot. The best option is to
portage over the right ledge and run the sneak around the bottom
on the right. The second is a tight sluice into an S-turn. Enter
the sluice, avoid the first pin rock turn hard right over the
drop and avoid the second pin rock, then finish with a hard
left over the bottom of the drop. The third drop is
immediately below. A huge undercut boulder forces the current
far left and creates an eddy to the right. Watch out for the
vortex sucking things under the boulder. A hard turn to the
right around the boulder and off a steep 6 ft drop, followed
with a small drop into a small eddy-pool. The fourth drop, "Possum
Stew" is a long complex rapid with several rocks and holes to
negotiate with a 5-6 foot drop in the middle. This drop
was portaged by all during the first descent due to a
large tree across the creek. This drop feeds the last of
the big five, the "Possum Hole". Large boulders block the
path. The left line is through a pyramid shaped hole (at
the right water level). The right line requires a hard 90+
degree turn to the left in front of a killer undercut
slot (this is one of the worst slots that this boater has
ever seen). Portage high on the right or climb over the
log debris on the left and wade through another pyramid
shaped hole then run the bottom part of the drop. The
creek continues intensity with some nice rock jumbles,
slides, and ledges. Notable drops are "Boof and Slide",
"Snake Eyes" and "Possum Pie", the last being a complex
drop (boof-slide, dodge, line up, over the 6 ft narrow
drop, avoid the tree and rock partially blocking the
outflow). The gradient continues to level off until the
confluence with Raccoon Creek. Raccoon contains some good
surf waves and decent current in the pools then joins the
Beech Fork for some nice volume. Several big waves and big
pools and one monster hole near the end. Finish with about
a 3/4 mile paddle across the NE corner of Greers Ferry
Lake to the Hwy 263 bridge. Like other micro-volume
creeks, meaningful ratings are difficult to establish on
the accepted International scale. At lower levels, the
creek will seem like a very technical class IV, with
much rock bashing, scraping, and some portages. At higher
levels, several rapids become solid class V. At
any level, the creek contains many serious hazards, and
any paddlers without experience negotiating undercut rocks
on tight, steep creeks should think twice before trying to
tame the Possum. Thanks go to Lance Jones and Randall Gammill
for information about Possum Walk Creek.

Rattlesnake Hollow
Rating: IV (V)
TDCR: 7794
Location: The put-in is reached by crossing Hurricane Cr. 8 miles
upstream from Shores Lake on NFR 1003 heading toward
White Rock Mtn. Dockery's Gap is fairly close to this crossing.
After you cross Hurricane (which should be huge and muddy),
go uphill about one mile until you see a good dirt road
angling down to the right (this road is not on USGS maps).
Follow this small, rough road about a half mile or so
until it crosses Rattlesnake Hollow (4WD is a very good idea).
The best idea in my opinion is to run the creek down to
where it crosses an old logging road right before it runs
into Hurricane Cr. From here, brushwhack up on the left
side of the creek (the left facing downstream on Rattlesnake),
angling away from the creek gorge as you go up. The slope is
not too bad. After about 150 to 200 yards (or so) you should
run into a good dirt road. Follow this back to the left (back
toward the creek) and stay on it as it paralells the creek
gorge and climbs back up to the put-in. If you don't stop and
rest too much, you can make it back up in less than 30 minutes
of easy boat dragging. If you really want to, set shuttle
on Hurricane Cr. down near Shores Lake and paddle down the
8 miles of class II water and trees. If you take the hiking
option, Rattlesnake can be run and shuttled in less than
1.5 hours, giving you time for a second run, either on
Rattlesnake or on one of the other local creeks.
Topo Quad(s): Fern
Gradient: 400 fpm
Length: 0.6 mi
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: This creek only runs when everything else is in flood. Putting
in an no more than an hour after a hard, fast rain (2+" in less
than 2 hours) is a must to catch it up. The good news is that
you can gauge it by driving to the put-in. The bedrock slide
just upstream of the put-in road should have water spreading
across it for a good solid run. Everything but the first
waterfall can be gotten down with even less water. If there's not
quite enough water, simply drive over to nearby Little Mill
or Spirits creek for a good run on one of those.
Hazards: one big waterfall, downed trees, and continuous water
Description: This strange little creek would probably have never been run
if the USFS had not made its rather unpopular decision to sell off
some timber around Hurricane Cr. and Whiterock Mtn. in 1998.
When they did this, they cut a road into this previously
inaccessible hollow. As if they had consulted a group of
paddlers when they did it, they chose to cross the hollow
about a half mile above Hurricane Cr., right above a 25+ foot
waterfall. As a result, it was run by Bill Herring and Trey
Marley in June of 2000. The short run is easy to describe: about
100 feet of fast water leads to a 25 foot sheer plunge into a
small 6 foot deep pool after which a rapid starts and doesn't stop
for about 1/2 mile. Then you pull out and carry back up a gentle
slope for about 150 yards to the road where you can drag
back up to the put-in in less than 30 minutes. The waterfall is
potentially the highlight of the run, but like all big falls, it
can be dangerous as hell. The first (and to date the only) attempt
to run it resulted in a piton into the gravel at the bottom.
This author can attest that the impact can be severe. The
problem with this fall is that water is spread out thinly over
the uneven lip of the drop. It's very easy to hang up on the
take-off resulting in a vertical landing in shallow water.
If your boat is longer than 5 feet, you're gonna stop very, very
abruptly! At very high levels, the fall may be more cleanly
runnable, but you're guinea-pigging it if you try. Obviuosly
this fall should be scouted carefully both from the top and bottom
before any future attempts. The pool below the fall is small and
it's washout is blocked by a tree, so you'll probably need to
portage at the bottom whether or not you run the fall. From here
the creek starts dropping and doesn't stop. If you can pick out
individual drops, all but one of them are probably class III.
But a severe shortage of boat sized eddys makes everything just
blend into one long class IV rapid. If a tree is down (very
likely) stopping before you hit it will be very interesting
(the creekbed is so narrow that grabbing a rock or tree on the
bank is probably the best way to slow down). The crux of the
run is a solid class IV drop over multiple ledges about halfway
down. This one pinned a boater on the first descent as his
boat disapeared completely into a crevice in the rocks.  
 Really, it's pointless to describe any of the drops. If
you are really sure you want to run it, strap your
seatbelt on below the big fall and just hang on until you
reach the bottom! Depending on your sense of adventure
and the water level, you'll either be completely exhilarated
or terrified by the time Hurricane Cr. comes into view.  
 If the water is high, hiking it on foot first is probably
the best way to stay out of serious trouble (it's a terrific
short hike when it's dry). Rattlesnake is a crazy, tiny little
creek that only a crazy creek boater can appreciate. If that
describes you, enjoy!

Richland Cr.
Rating: S1: III-IV
S2: II-III
TDCR: 6656 (S1)
Location: Newton and Searcy Co.;
S1: Take Hwy. 65 north of Conway from I-40 and then Hwy.
16 west of Clinton to Ben Hur. then NFR 1203
north to low water bridge at put-in. Take out at
Richland Cr. campground north of Hwy. 16 on
NFR 1205.
S2: Take out by driving north of Richland Cr. Campground on
NFR 1205 and then turn north on NFR 1201 and go to
Stack Rock.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Moore, Eula
Gradient: S1: 55 fpm (some sections approach 80 fpm)
S2: 20 fpm
Length: S1: 6 mi.
S2: 10 mi.
Season: FALL and SPRING
Gauge: Low water bridge at the put-in should have between
18 and 5 in. of airspace showing. Richland Campground bridge
should have 3 to 1 ft of airspace. The ACC Bulletin Board
gauge should read between 3.5 and 5.0 ft. A level of 3.3 on
the the Corps On-Line gauge (follow link below)
corresponds to approx. 12 in. of airspace at put-in bridge.
Levels over these maximum limits easily push the creek into
the class IV-V range. You can also predict the levels using
the Buffalo R. rain gauges which are linked below.
LINK BUFFALO NATIONAL R. GAUGES (UPDATED HOURLY)
LINK TO USGS GAUGE
Hazards: dangerous rapids, undercut rocks, bad hydraulics
Description: S1 is one of the premier advanced whitewater runs in
the state. The first mile is relatively calm but the next
five contain several class III-IV rapids including a six
foot drop at Richland Falls and others such as Crack in
the Rock (III+), Knuckle Buster (III+), Upper Screw Up (III),
Lower Screw Up (AKA Shaw's Folly) (IV), and Maytag (III). The
most dangerous drop is Lower Screw Up which has a badly undercut
rock in the far right hand slot which is the preferred entrance
to the rapid, but many of the other rapids can be rough on an
inverted paddler (especially at lower levels). At higher
levels the water volume and steep gradient can be a very
dangerous combination making for a solid class IV-V run (if
Richland is too high try Falling Water Cr to the south). A hike
up to Twin Devils Fork falls (below Richland Falls) provides
some extra scenery, and the rest of the run is very scenic, but
it's hard to take your eyes off of the rapids! Only confident
intermediates to expert boaters should attempt upper Richland.
Be sure you have the requisite eddy hopping, ferrying, and
rolling skills or you may be doing more hiking than boating.
S2 is more tame, but still provides plenty of good action in
the first few miles. The end of this stretch is relatively
flat as it approaches the Buffalo R.

Rock Creek
Rating: II-III _
TDCR: 4464
Location: From I-40 take Hwy 215 (the Mulberry exit) north approx.
3.5 miles and turn left (west) just before you cross over
Mill Cr. Stay on the main road always going west until you
reach the four-way at Piney. Turn left (west) and go about
a mile until the road T's. Take a right and go another mile
until you come to a bridge. This is the put-in. To get to
the take-out, go back to the T in the road and continue
straight (south) at the T. Follow this road until you reach
another intersection. Hang a right and go about one mile to
the creek.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Mountainburg SE
Gradient: 75 fpm
Length: 2.75 mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: The Mulberry should be flooded (7+ ft on the gauge). This
creek requires some serious rainfall to come up.
Hazards: strainers, undercuts
Description: First descent on this creek was on 2/21/97, just before
a run on Little Mill Cr. to the east. The group was made
up of ten boaters: Steve Robertson, Landon Colwell, Alex
Woolworth, Zen Boulden, Richard Haley, Kent Peetz,
Josh Webster, Eddie Cross, and a guy named Tim. The first 1/4
mile of the creek is clogged with strainers, but there is a
good trail on river right to get around the trees. But the
next mile is well worth the trouble, dropping 100 ft. in
a nice gorge. Class II to III rapids are encountered with
no pools to slow things down. Many strainers and some
undercuts may also be encountered so be sure to stay on your
toes. The very continuous nature of the run makes the
hazards much more dangerous than they would be elsewhere.
This creek lies somewhere between the Salt Fork and Spirits
Cr. in overall difficulty and excitement. It's a good training
ground for would be steep creekers who have the skills to
handle the pushy, narrow rapids. If you don't then consider
Hurricane Cr. or the Salt Fork which are only a few minutes
drive to the east. Thanks go to Steve Robertson for
information on this run.

Roger's Private Idaho
Rating: II
TDCR: ????
Location: From Poughkeepsie (Sharp County), go north on Highway 58
approximately 1-2 miles. Look for a county road sign
marking Hulett Road on the left. There is also single house
on the left side jsut north of the road. Take this left and
go about 1 mile to low-water bridge. Park on river left
side. Please help keep this area clean when visiting!
Topo Quad(s): N/A
Gradient: N/A
Length: Park and Play
Season: RAIN
Gauge: The USGS Strawberry River Gauge near Poughkeepsie should be above 2.5
for a low surfable level on the wave. Above 3.7 the surfing is best.
Hazards: Initial inspection shows no rebar as wave is made solely
by existing bedrock. May be shallow at some levels so watch your head.
Description: This is a great park and play wave located just
downstream of the low-water bridge on the Strawberry R.
The wave is relatively wide with a foam pile at levels of 4 feet
and above on river right with glassy surface on the left. Two large
eddies on either side provide plenty of recovery and room to wait in
line. The wave train below the surfing wave has some smaller waves
that some might find entertaining. Higher levels make for
ideal conditions for kayaks and expert open-boaters. As
the level drops, it becomes friendlier to less-skilled
boaters. Thanks to Roger Head for information on his great
play wave!

Salt Fork
Rating: II-III
TDCR: 4454
Location: Take Hwy. 215 (Mulberry exit) north from I-40 to Shores
Lake. Go south of the lake, cross Hurricane Cr., and
continue uphill past the dam and lake overlook. Take a left
(north) at the first four way intersection and drive three
miles. Take a left at the second four way intersection and
drive two more miles to a low water bridge at the put-in.
The take-out is back at Shores L. Try to take out on the
north end of the lake to avoid as much flat water as
possible. With a little quick shuttling, you may be able to
catch Spirits Cr. or Hurricane Cr. after you take off,
assuming the Salt Fork didn't completely wear you out.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Bidville
Gradient: 75 fpm
Length: 4 mi.
Season: RAIN
Gauge: The only way to be sure is to check at the put-in bridge.
The first ledge on Hurricane Cr. below Shores L. bridge should
be covered completely, and the Mulberry should probably be
over 6 ft.
Hazards: Numerous tree strainers and willow jungles. Scout all blind
curves!
Description: This great little run is one of the best kept secrets in
the Ozarks. Fast paced class II+ rapids characterize the
majority of the run, but there are a few legitimate III's
at any level and the majority of the run may be pushy III
at higher water. Great surfing opportunities abound in
the second half of the run. In some places there are four
or five good surfing holes separated by only a few yards.
But don't get too relaxed by all of that playing, because
there are a few spots with some nasty strainers. Be
extremely careful around willow jungles and blind turns.
Some of the most challenging rapids and the best scenery
occur right at the end of the run, and then the feisty
little Salt Fork disappears under Shores Lake. You can take
out anywhere on the lake, but it's best to drive to the
picnic areas on the north side. Just make sure you don't
paddle over the 30 ft. dam on the south end. The fall
won't kill you but the landing might. Salt Fork is a good
run for paddlers comfortable on tight, fast class III
water. If you can't maneuver in these conditions, try a
run on Hurricane creek on the other side of Shores Lake.

Shop Cr.
Rating: III-V _
TDCR: 8878
Location: Newton Co.; Take USFS Road 1206D (unmarked dirt road)
north of Hwy. 16 from Deer till you pass Alum Cove. Before
you reach Wayton, there are two dirt roads in quick succession
that head west (to the left). Shortly after these a single
dirt track heads due east at a 90 deg. angle to the main road.
Take this road and drive about 1/2 mile then walk the trail
leading downhill and to the east 1/2 mile. When you reach
the bottom of the gorge head left and you will intersect the
creek. This is the put-in. Take out at the bridge south of
Parthenon. (NOTE: the creek is labeled as West Fork Shop Cr.
on my Parthenon topo quad. Spellings of "Shop" Cr. may vary.)
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Deer, Parthenon
Gradient: 120 fpm (upper gorge is 200 fpm)
Length: > 6 mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: The EFLB should be flooded for a run on Shop Cr. A put in soon
after very heavy rainfall is required for a run.
Hazards: Strainers, tight and technical drops, undercuts
Description: Shop Cr. was first run by Randy Jackson and Robert
Handford in March 1988. It has been run only a few times since.
It is a very steep, tight, technical run with solid, continuous
class III-IV rapids in the upper 200 fpm section. Big rocks
form big, continuous drops with lots of hazards. Major drops
include (but are not limited to): Hypermart (IV), Checkout Line
(V), Blue Light Special (III+), Express Lane (III), No Refund
(III), and Thanks for Shopping (III+). Above and between
Hypermart and Checkout Line the creek is nearly continuous
class III+. All boaters should have very, very
advanced skills and be confident on tight class IV+ water.
Be prepared for severe consequences if you underestimate the
difficulty of this run or overestimate your skill. A high water
trip in June, 2000 resulted in several very good paddlers walking
out of the gorge, and one needing dental work. Be careful out
there. Thanks to Shelby Johnson for information on this creek.

Smith Cr.
Rating: III-V
TDCR: 8986
Location: Newton Co.; Two put-ins are possible. The first of these is
off of Shiloh Rd. that turns East off of Hwy. 21 near Mossville (this
is the road the the EFLB takeout). Follow this road for a short
distance until you come to a USFS timer cutting area on the right
(look for the signs). If you cross a cattle grate you've gone too
far. Park on the right in the timber cutting area, and hike down to
the creek on the left had side of the road (also USFS land). The hike
is almost 1/4 mile and is way downhill. Once you get down, you'll darn
sure be running the creek! A much better put-in is found by taking the
second dirt road to the left after passing the Hwy. 21 Smith Cr.
bridge on your way south to Mossville. (NOTE: This put-in is private
property but the owners don't mind paddlers using it for a put-in when
the creek is running. Please treat the land with great respect and
pick up any trash you find, so we can make sure the access to this
great creek run continues.) Thanks to the owners improving the road,
you may be able to drive this road all the way to the creek if
you have a high clearance 4WD vehicle. The first hill is a
real doozy to get back up though, so you may want to do a little
shuttle scouting to be sure you want to try it! Once down the first
hill (either in your vehicle or dragging your boat) bear to your
right and follow the road to the Southwest. At the bottom of the
first hill, another road/trail branches off and goes more steeply
downhill and to the Northwest. This road will take you just below
the Lower Gorge and is a good spot to take out. When you get to the
creek you can put in for the Lower Gorge, or you can follow the
road upstream over a couple of small tributaries about 1/4 mile to
get to the Upper Gorge. A take-out at the Hwy. 21 bridge is possible
but not recommended since it requries paddling the lower creek which
has many fences across it and is surrounded by private land. Unless
you can somehow duck the fences, the lower creek cannot be run
without portaging, so you'll have to seek permission from
landowners first.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Boxley, Murray
Gradient: 130 fpm (upper 2.5 mi. @ 180 fpm)
Length: 2 to 5 mi. (depending on put-in and take-out)
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Generally 3 to 6 ft of water over the low water bridge over the
Buffalo R. at Ponca is a good indicator. At the Hwy 21 bridge
over Smith Cr. no rocks should be visible in the flow near the
bridge and the water should be muddy. The creek is only runnable
after extremely heavy local rains. You may be able to predict the
levels using the Buffalo R. rain gauges which are linked below.  
 The Ponca and Buffalo Tower gauges are the ones to watch. 2+ inches
of rain in a few hours may be enough to produce a good run. If the
creek looks flooded at the put-in, it probably is, and you'll be
portaging class VI nightmares in the gorge if it's that high!
LINK BUFFALO NATIONAL R. GAUGES (UPDATED HOURLY)
Hazards: strainers, undercut rocks, barbed wire fences (above
upper gorge and below lower gorge), severe rapids, hydraulics
Description: First run in May, 1995 by Bill and Chanoy Herring and
Chris Monroe, this creek has two of the toughest gorges in the
Ozarks (the Lower Gorge may have been partly explored as early as
1978). The uppermost put-in is a 1/4 mile climb down from a
dirt road East of Mossville. From this location the creek drops
at a rate of over 180 fpm for the next 2.5 miles with continuous
class III rapids and many nasty deadfalls that must be portaged.
One mile from the upper put-in, the creek drops more than 60 ft.
in 1/10 mi. and is choked to less than 5 ft. wide by several
house sized boulders in the stream bed. The result of this is a
nasty class V+ gorge! When you see the creek choking down
to a really narrow slot on river left, eddy out immediately
and portage on the left (where there is an old roadbed).  
 The first drop is very questionable, and if you accidentally
enter this gorge, it may be the last thing you ever run! One
half mile later you'll arrive at the put-in for the lower gorge
run. From this access point to Hwy. 21 is only about 3 miles,
but the first of those miles is very intense. After a half mile of
fast class III water you'll encounter the Lower Gorge where the creek
drops 100 ft. in 1/3 mile. This gorge features back-to-back class
IV-V rapids. The major rapids encountered in the Lower Gorge
include: Little Bull (IV), Looking for Trouble (IV),
Trouble (V+), Crack in the Rock (IV), Gunbarrel (III+),
Smith Falls (IV+), Box Sluice (III), and Whippersnaper (III).
All of these rapids have been run at certain water levels,
but each of them harbors undercut traps. All should
be bank scouted very carefully. Taken as a whole, the
Lower Gorge is basically a long class V whitewater rapid.  
 Indeed, at moderate to high water levels, the continuous nature
of the rapids from Looking For Trouble down to Smith Falls may
commit the paddler to running all of these drops at once.  
 Little Bull pushes 75% of the creek into a big undercut on the
right, Trouble is basically an undercut rock sieve, Crack in the
Rock funnels about half of the water in the creek under and through
a big ledge, and a very large undercut just below Smith Falls has
already been the site of a near accident. Needless to say
you'd better have 100% confidence in your ability to run a
clean line through these tricky drops! After the Lower Gorge
the creek settles down to a continuous class II-III run until
its confluence with the Buffalo R. Due to private land and
fencing across the creek (do not try to remove these fences!)
the creek is not really boatable below the Lower Gorge.
Take out on the trail at the end of the Lower Gorge and hike
back up the hill to get to your vehicle. Smith Cr. is a very
serious run due to the extreme hazards encountered in the
two inner gorges. The gorges are short, but don't expect to
get through or around them quickly. If you're not a seasoned
creek boater, you may find yourself doing a lot of hiking as
you try to "run" the creek.

South Fork Little Red R.
Rating: I-III
TDCR: 3355
Location: Van Buren County;
S1: On Hwy 16 after going through Alread and Rupert, turn left
onto Anchor Rd. just past the Pleasant Grove Church. When Anchor
T's turn right onto Brock Rd., and when Brock splits go right
and then onto Moonlight Rd. 2WD's can park up on the hill and drag
down. 4WD's can continue down the hill on a woods road to a
lower parking area, and then put in on the river at a 4 wheeler
crossing at N35 38.537 W092 44.649, take out is on river left at the
ford below Koown Hollow on FR 1342 at N35 33.193 W092 43.869.
S2: Put in at FR 1342 crossing below Koone Hollow, or at lower
end of Brushy Fork (4wd only), or about a mile downstream on
FR 1307 (Slick Rock Road). This road has recently been improved and
offers better access for all vehicles, take out on river left at
the low water bridge in Gulf Mt. WMA on Cottonwood Rd. at W35 34.275
N092 39.762, which runs north south connecting Lo Gap to
Gulf Mt. Rd. Warning, the large culverts can trap you at the
higher levels.
S3: Take out at the Lo Gap bridge at N35 34.182 W092 37.286 on
river right above the bridge. Landowner permission required,
see description below.
S4: Take out is at Hwy 95 bridge on river right.
Topo Quad(s): ?
Gradient: 12 to 66 fpm (depending on section)
Length: S1: 9 mi.
S2: 7.0 mi.
S3: 3.5 mi.
S4: 5.0 mi.
Season: RAIN
Gauge: The minimum level on the USGS gauge at Clinton is around 7.0 feet
for S1, 6.0 for S2, and 5.5 for S3. A level check can be made at both
the Hwy 95 bridge and at the low water bridge with culverts on
Cottonwood Rd. At Hwy 95, water should be pooling on river
right above the bridge where the woods road enters. At the
low water bridge, 4" of water passing through the culverts
is the necessary minimum for a S3 put in.
Hazards: Downed tree tops, logs, and strainers are likely, one wire
cable across creek in S1.
Description: The South Fork of the Little Red is a very
scenic river loaded with rapids. S1 is very rain
dependent and starts off with lots of rock bumping action
and a 66 fpm gradient. It's low volume at first, with
narrow, technical rapids. The upper run has very few pools,
and is only suitable for boaters with good boat control,
elbow pads, and a sturdy hull. Depending on rainfall, one
rapid may be class III. A logged area about 2 miles down
is a good place to watch for strainers. At around 4
miles, Wilson creek enters from river left and the river
picks up speed. About mile 8, hunters have placed a
wire cable (N 35 33.725 W 092 44.738) across the creek
above Koown Hollow, probably in order to walk across
the river during hunting season. Signs of downed cables
were also present and should be watched for in this area.
The cables we last encountered were about 12" above our heads.
A warning sign has been placed on a tree upstream from the
cable, and the cable has also been painted. S2 at 7 miles
is more pool drop, allowing more enjoyment of the scenery.
Around mile 5, as the river turns left, the Root Wad
rapid, with a snag waiting at the bottom is located at N35
33.877 W 092 41.390 and can be trouble. Two miles later
the low water bridge on Cottonwood Rd. in the WMA is reached.
Take out is on river left at the bridge. Be careful, as the
large culverts can be a trap at the higher levels. S3 flows
through 3.5 miles of nice scenery and ends by passing
first by a low water bridge under a historic wooden
suspension bridge and then under the new CR 9 bridge
at Lo Gap. Permission from the landowner at Bear Hole Hollow
Farm must be obtained prior to using this location as a take
out or put in. Do not drive through the gate onto the
property. Drag your boats in/out instead. S4 offering 5.0
miles, is more nice scenery at a slower pace with some fun
rapids, a set of nice surfing ledges, and a few camps
dotted along the banks. Take out is just above the Hwy 95
bridge on river right. Thanks go to Chester for info.

Spadra Cr.
Rating: III+
TDCR: ????
Location: Spadra creek runs through the middle of Clarksville, AR. The
main take out is in the middle of town where Main Street
Bridge and Cherry Street Bridge cross the creek. Go down to
the stone building beside the creek to park your car. To
get to the put-in, turn at the stop light beside the
Southern Flames Music Theater and head up toward the
College of the Ozarks. Right after the College, the road
splits off. Take the road to the right and stay on it until
you cross two bridges. The second bridge goes over Spadra
creek. This is where the gauge is. You can put in here or
you can keep going up the road until another road comes in
on the left. Turn left and go about a mile to the first bridge
and and take a another left. Go about twenty yards and put in
on the left side of the road.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Clarksville, Ludwig
Gradient: 30 fpm
Length: 8 or 12 mi. (depending on your put-in)
Season: RAIN
Gauge: There should be at most 4 feet of airspace under the middle
bridge. With less than 3 ft. of airspace you should expect
a very pushy run. There is also a gauge on the USGS page.
About 4 ft. is minimal on this gauge, over 6 ft is optimal,
and over 8 ft. is high and pushy.
Hazards: willow strainers, keeper hydraulics, low-head dam (near
the end of the run)  
 Description: Just down from the uppermost put-in you will encounter
a very nice rapid with good surfing. After this, you will
see the bridge. A good hole above the bridge provides an
excellent opportunely for 360's, but be careful because
the hole immediately below is a serious keeper. Next up are
some great surfing ledges. After these, the river splits
as it goes through a reclaimed coal mine. Take the left fork
and watch for trees. Soon after this there is a bad willow
jungle. Stay far right in this jungle and you'll be in good
shape. A bit more river will bring you to a house on
a cliff, where the river pushes up against the cliff. A
pourover on river left is a good spot for enders and squirt
moves. A long continuous stretch of rapids just upstream
of the middle bridge ends with Nomie's Rapid (Nomie swam
this one on a very cold day!). After the middle bridge
(the second put-in), you'll have waves, holes, and willows
for the next 3 miles. After this is Quarter Mile Rapid,
a long series of waves and holes. At high levels the holes
are huge and sticky, so stay on your toes here. After a few
more rapids, you'll encounter a large, ugly willow jungle.
You can recognize the spot by the camp and water pipe on
river right. To run the willows, take a left, then another
left, and finally another left when you see a Chevy with
a tree sticking through the hood. About a mile after this
hazard there are a few fences across the creek. Be careful
around these. After the fences, you will have a few rapids
and pools and then an some buildings (an old water plant)
and an old dam will loom ahead. Take the chute to the right
around the dam. The hydraulic below the dam is a death trap
so be sure you get to the right to avoid it. Next up is
Water Plant Rapid. It is the biggest on the river and a
scream at any water level. The next time the river splits
take a left, and then take a right and cross a big downed
tree. The take-out is on the right just downstream of the
two bridges. Also, remember that most of Spadra Cr. is on
private land, so respect the rights of local landowners and
try to keep the creek and the land around it clean. If there
is very much water at all, all boaters on Spadra should be
comfortable with big, pushy class III water and big holes
(similar to the Ocoee R. in Tennessee, but less continuous).
Thanks to Noah Fraiser and Curtis Milsap for the description
of this great creek.

Spirits Cr.
Rating: III
TDCR: 5464
Location: Take Hwy. 215 (Mulberry exit) north from I-40 to Shores
Lake. Go south of the lake, cross Hurricane Cr., and
continue uphill past the dam and lake overlook. Take a left
(north) at the first four way intersection and drive three
miles. Take a right at the second four way intersection and
drive a mile to a low water bridge at the put-in. To reach
the take-out, go back the way you came and hang a left
at the first four way (back toward Shores L.). When you
reach the next four way (should look familiar) turn left
and drive one mile to the wooden bridge over Spirits Cr.
This road is the Capmbell's Cemetery road that goes to Cass.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Bidville
Gradient: 75 fpm (1st mile @ 100 fpm)
Length: 4 mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: The Mulberry R. gauge should be greater than 8 ft. and Hurricane
Cr. should look high and muddy. Runnable only after heavy
local rains.
Hazards: dangerous strainers (esp. in 3rd mile), undercut rock at First
Ledge
Description: This run has continuous class II-III rapids, an extremely
narrow stream bed (10 - 15 ft wide), and one 12 ft. class III+
fall (The Funnel at the end of the third mile) that is one of
the best drops in the state. It is highly recommended to
those who have the skills needed to run the non-stop rapids.
Strainers are very common, and usually a portage or two will be
needed. The first 1/4 mile can be scouted from a trail on
river right to determine a strategy for approaching First
Ledge, a five foot class III drop. Avoid the eddy on the
left below this ledge. The current flows under a potentially
hazardous undercut boulder on this side. The Funnel is the
highlight of the run. It is located just after a two ft.
sloping ledge with a river wide hydraulic. When the river
makes a sharp bend to the right, pull out and scout from
the old road on river right. The drop here is over ten
feet, and, although it is easier to run than it first appears,
it is quite shallow at most levels. An inverted paddler
is very likely to lose some skin. A trail on river right
makes it easy to carry up and run the big flume again and again.
Spirits is a great introduction to the tight steep creeks
of the Ozarks, but the very continuous nature of this run can
make it dangerous for paddlers with anything less than perfect
boat control. All boaters should be confident intermediates
before trying to tackle Spirits Cr.

Stepp Cr.
Rating: III-IV+
TDCR: 8983
Location: Take-out is reached by turning north onto County Rd. 8,
a gravel road leading from Swain at Hwy. 16 to the low water
slab over the EFLB near the Murray Community Center. The turn at
Swain is about one mile east of the intersection where Hwy.
21 turns north off of Hwy. 16 to go to Boxley - look for a sign
that advertizes for "Pottery and Gifts". Follow this
gravel road for a while until it it forks. Take the rougher
looking, steep dirt road downhill to the right. Continue
driving through the beautiful country until the road turns
left alongside the East Fork of the Little Buffalo R. (a
possible takeout point for that run). If the water is high,
the East Fork may be up over the road - please don't block
the road parking as several folks live down in this valley.
If the EFLB is not covering the road, there is room for
parking on the opposite side of the road from the creek
just before you reach the creek crossing. The best put-in
for the lower gorge is to drive a bit more than 1.5 miles
back up the hill and look for the turnout to park in on the
right (again, don't block the road and irritate the
landowners!). Carry your boat downhill on the road about a
third of a mile to the second culvert funneling water
under the road and then start angling downhill away from
the road. It's a steep, tough brushwhack, but it's only
about a quarter mile long. With some luck you should reach
the confluence of Gum Br. and Stepp Cr. (hopefully with all
of your limbs unbroken!). It's an excellent idea to consult
a topo map (Murray quad) and explore this little hike
before the day of your run to work out the logistics.
IMPORTANT NOTE: a small road near the takeout follows the
EFLB upstream and crosses Stepp Cr., but this is private
property and the landowner doesn't want visitors - please
respect his privacy and DO NOT DRIVE UP THIS ROAD. Thanks!
Topo Quad(s): Murray, Swain
Gradient: 150 fpm
Length: 1.5 mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Stepp Cr. can generally been run with the EFLB at optimal
levels or higher. If rain is widespread, a level of 6 feet
or higher on the USGS Buffalo at Boxley gauge can be a good
indicator. The National Park Service's Swain and Deer rain
gauges are great indicators for this run. Look for 1 to 2
inches in a couple of hours. A quick walk up the road that
follows the EFLB upstream from the takeout will take you to
the Stepp Cr. confluence. If there's enough water to run
this last rapid before the EFLB, then there'll be enough
water to get down the lower gorge. Don't drive up this road
or walk any farther than the confluence though as it runs
through private property.
LINK BUFFALO NATIONAL R. GAUGES (UPDATED HOURLY)
Hazards: Continuous severe rapids, undercuts, trees, and sieves.
Description: The difficult access to Stepp Cr. led to it being first
run somewhat accidentally on November 29, 2004. Bill
"Fish" Herring and Ryan Center hiked in with boats
thinking they would drag down the creek at sub-minimal
water levels only to be pleasantly suprised. Stepp Creek's
lower gorge starts at the Gum Br. confluence and the
action doesn't let up for more than a mile. With a
relatively large watershed and long, rocky drops, Stepp
compares to its eastern cousin, Bobtail Cr. Both creeks
have good rapids even at low levels, and such levels on
these creeks happen surprisingly often. In fact, not much
more rainfall is required to run Stepp Cr. than for the
EFLB itself. At higher water levels, Stepp's gorge
ratchets up into the class IV+ range in a hurry. With
enough water the nearly continuous, big drops will challenge
even the most experienced steep creek boater. The first
drop in the gorge is called "Double Bubble" - a blind
chute on the right leads to a boulder that can be avoided with
a hard cut to the left. Those new to the creek may want
to scout this drop and possibly several more below it.
The water doesn't stop moving for the next quarter mile.
Next is "Thighmaster", named for Ryan Center's bruised
upper leg after swimming the log-choked river-left
sluice on the first descent. This one can be snuck
with a good ferry to the far right slot. The left
side is a Z-shaped slot that features a wicked hole
that tends to backender anything that passes through it.
The hole recirculates under the rock on the right and
then the backwash kicks out into another undercut
straight ahead. If it sounds bad, it typically looks
and boats even worse! Scout this one carefully and set
good bank support on the left before trying the sneak
or a run of the main slot. The creekin continues with
a couple of long drops followed by another slot drop
into a surging, boxed-in hole. This is "The Chute"
and it is another great spot to set a rope. A short
pool leads to a ledge hole that is the start of Stepp
Creek's biggest rapid: "Eight Seconds". Like riding
an angry bull, a good run in this class IV+ drop will
take about 8 seconds. A bad line will take considerably
longer trying to escape from holes and pin-rocks! Runs
tend to disintegrate here about four or five moves down
from the top hole. A number of folks have been thrown
off the bull and had some rough rides to the bottom.
The next major drop is called "Pac Man":
a big boof that kisses the rock is possible on the left or
take the twisting route through boulders on the right.
Look back upstream at this one - a very cool looking drop!
Several more class III+ and IV drops follow, but the pace
slows down to a more managable speed after Pac Man. The
scenery is fantastic if you can take your eyes off the
rapids! If you can find it, there's even a wonderful
creek boat ender spot near the bottom of the run - a
great way to finish your trip! When you see a field on
your right, the banks are private property, so don't
get out of your boat and float through quietly so as
to not disturb the landowner who lives there. At the
confluence with the EFLB, hang a left through the bushes
(it's quite possible to swim here!) and paddle 100 yards
to your vehicle. Another run on Stepp is possible (known
as "doing the two Stepp"), or you can head up the EFLB
or over to Thomas Cr. for some more creekin' action!
Stepp's lower gorge is a great creek run that has serious
hazards, especially when the holes are churning at
higher levels - all paddlers need to be able to handle
continuous class IV+ water and organize bank support.
If you're not prepared, it may give you more excitement
than you want!

Sulphur Creek (Richland)
Rating: IV-V+ _
TDCR: ????
Location: There are many Sulphur Creeks in Arkansas; this is the one
in the Richland Cr. watershed downstream of Bobtail Cr.
Reach the put-in by going North on Hwy 377 from Witts
Springs about 3 miles to the edge of the community of Magic
Springs turn left on a dirt road. Take the first fork right
and the second fork left (90 degree turns). Go about 3/4 mile
look for a 4WD drive road to the right (should be on
National Forest land now). Road ends very shortly at a
small partial clearing with several berms. Park and drag
down the ATV/Horse trail past the NF gate until the trail
turns sharply to the left. Bushwack downhill, due North, or
follow the first rivulet from the trail. Put-in on the
South fork of the creek 0.25 above the confluence with the
West fork. (elv. 1300 ft). Take out is at Richland Cr.
Campground. If the water is high (very likely) may consider
accessing from the East. Go North on 377 to Snowball and
follow Point Peter road to Richland Creek.
Topo Quad(s): Eula, Moore, Snowball, and Witts Springs
Gradient: 320 fpm (some sections 500 to 700 fpm)
Length: 1.5 mi (plus 3.5 mi on Richland Cr.)
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Gauge at Richland Campground needs to be above 6 feet. Look
for 2" or more rain at the Tilly and surrounding rain
gages, as posted on the ACC Resource Page. Rain must have
fallen within the last 6 to 12 hours.
Hazards: Undercut ledges and rocks, overhanging branches, strainers,
waterfalls. With 500 and 700 ft/mile sections, this one is
steep! Several portages are advised.
Description: First known run was April 5, 1997. By Cowper Chadbourn,
Lance Jones, Greg Churan and Nathan Kline. Sulphur Creek
doesn't have any monsterly tall drops, just lots and lots
of 3 to 15 footers. Very blind, very undercut, very tight
and extremely beautiful. Several drops land on poorly
padded shelf rock, and one funnels 90% of the water into a
NASTY undercut cave. Sulphur Creek is 1.5 miles from
put-in described to Richland Creek, then another 3.5 miles
to the normal Lower Richland take-out. Average gradient on
the creek is 350 ft/mile. First mile averages 400 ft/mile,
with sections approaching 500 to 700 ft/mile. Sulphur
starts out with a very tight slot move leading to the only
"waterfall". Run the tight slot in a right hand turn with
boat on edge (won't go through flat) onto the shelf rock
and hug as close to the large undercut boulder on the
right to go over "Sulphur Falls". There is a rock in the
middle of the pool at the bottom. (I know, because my bow
found it!) A few more tight boulder jumbles follow until
the confluence with the West fork. Enjoy this shallow
pool, because it's the only one you get. The pool feeds a
two-step stair drop of about 6 feet. Scout the next drop
from the right. Steep, tight boulder drop with wood in it.
(at least during our run) After this, it's all a blur
with too many drops to mention. My advice: SCOUT
everything you can't see. Some of the drops that stick out
are Pin-Rock, The Cauldron, The Cave, many good
slots and boofs, and an 8-10 foot drop onto poorly padded rock.
One of the last big drops funnels around both sides of a
10-12 foot boulder into a hole in front of another 5-6 ft
boulder. Past this one the creek funnels through an
opening under two very large boulders. Enjoy a flush down
the remainder of Lower Richland. It is highly recommended
to hike this creek before attempting a run. Like other
micro-volume creeks, meaningful ratings are difficult to
establish on the accepted International scale. At lower
levels, the creek will seem like a very technical class
IV-V, with much rock bashing, scraping, and many portages.
At higher levels, most rapids are expected to become solid
class V. Make sure you have plenty of experience on other
Ozark steep creeks before you try to tackle Sulphur, and
it is a very good idea to hike it before running.

Tanyard Creek
Rating: III-IV (V) _
TDCR: ????
Location: The creek is found by taking the Town Center exit off of
Hwy. 71 North in Bella Vista. Take a left at the light and
follow the highway. You will go over the Tanyard Creek bridge -
an optional takeout. Further up the highway you will
go up a large hill and there will be a sign on the right
that says "Lake Windsor Dam". Turn left there, and follow the
road to the dam. The creek begins on the east side of the dam
below the spillway.
Topo Quad(s): N/A
Gradient: 65 fpm
Length: .75 mi
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Only runnable after very heavy rains. A good indicator would
be flooded ponds on any of the golf courses along Hwy. 71
in Bella Vista.
Hazards: very swift water, boulders, strainers near the bottom
Description: First run on 6/21/2000 by Jason and Robert Bertschy,
Tanyard Creek is a very short but dangerous creek. It is a
class V/IV/III run, in that order. Fed by Lake Windsor, the
whole stretch is only about 3/4 mile, and the intense rapids
come in a section only 300 yards long. The put-in is
located a little way down a trail that follows the spillway to
the north. You must drop in off of a large boulder (it will
be obvious) to start the run. The first rapid is a massive
drop with an extremely shallow landing. You would
probably have to be crazy to run this fall since the potential
for injury appears to be very high. Next up is Penny’s Plunge,
a 8 to 9 foot drop that can easily push you into an undercut
ledge on river right (nicknamed "Sideburns"). Penny’s Plunge
should be run on the right. The Plunge can be portaged
on the left by following the trail downhill 25 yards. The
next rapid, "Gone to Bosnia", signifies that the war has
begun. This is a class IV drop of 5 or 6 ft. Next, you
encounter "Where’d He Go", a class III+ drop of 4 feet. This
drop produces a large hole that can completely swamp a boat.
After this rapid you have about 40 yards before hitting
"Headhunter". This is a class II rapid that runs under a
bridge which is low enough to take your head off.
After Headhunter, the creek slows down and flattens out for
the remaining 500 yards. There could be strainers below all the
action, so scout well before running. There is NO recovery
time on this run, and if you blink you might miss the
rapids - but they may not miss you. Only serious boaters
should run Tanyard Cr., it is strongly suggested that
no one try to run the first drop! Thanks to Robert Bertschy
for information about this strange, cool little creek.

Thomas Cr.
Rating: III-IV _
TDCR: 6667
Location: Newton Co; Put in is reached by taking Shiloh
Rd. east of Hwy. 21 just south of Mossville. Drive for
0.2 miles and take the small dirt road on the right.  
 Descend the hill keeping to the right all the way down.
After you pass a small clearing on the left the road switches
back to the right. This is a prudent place to park and
hike down to the creek (unless you have a really good 4 wheel
drive and a winch!). The take out is reached by
following the right fork of Shiloh Rd. to the low water slab
that is the take out for the East Fork of the Little Buffalo.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Murray
Gradient: 110 fpm (upper 2 miles at 140 fpm)
Length: 4.5 mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Only runnable after heavy local rains. The Buffalo should
probably be two feet or more over the low water bridge at Ponca.
You may be able to predict the levels using the Buffalo R. rain
gauges which are linked below. The Swain and Deer gauges are
the ones to watch.
LINK BUFFALO NATIONAL R. GAUGES (UPDATED HOURLY)
Hazards: killer attack trees, big drops, high gradient
Description: First known run of this creek was in March of 1988
by Randy Jackson and his gang. The gradient in the first
two miles is a steady 140 fpm. Some big drops are created
as the boulder choked creek races down a small gorge. A
ten ft. fall is encountered near the beginning of the run.
This fall is very rocky at the bottom, and equipment or
paddler damage is a very real possibility there. You can
portage this one on the left. The next two miles consist
of nearly constant tricky class III drops. Stay on your toes
in this section. At one point a boulder and log sieve makes
for a mandatory 200 yard portage, and strainers can easily
block the narrow creek almost anywhere. One of the rapids was
dubbed "Action Jackson" in '88 when an undercut on the left of
a zig-zag staircase drop swallowed Randy Jackson's paddle.
The paddle was retrieved several days later after the water
level had dropped. The gradient continues to produce some
good rapids until just upstream of the EFLB confluence when
everything flattens out for the next half mile. This is
a fun run for advanced boaters who are used to narrow, high
gradient Ozark creeks, but it could be a nightmare for the
unprepared. Get very comfortable on runs such as Richland Cr.
before trying Thomas Cr.

Upper Ellis Br.
Rating: III-IV
TDCR: 7672
Location: To get to the put-in, take Hwy 170 from West Fork to Devils
Den State Park. Three miles before you reach Devils Den  
 turn right (west) on the Zinamon Church Rd. (unpaved).  
 Follow this road for 1/3 to 1/2 mile and turn left by the
American Trash sign (the second left off of the Zinnamon
Rd.). Go approx. 1 mile down this road and take the
first dirt road to the right (if you reach a house you've  
 gone too far). This road is very rugged and steep and
you'll pass several "NO HUNTING" signs on the way down.  
 It's private land, and getting permission from the hunting
club that owns it might not be a bad idea. I spoke with
a man who lives close to the creek, and he said no one would
mind, but it never hurts to double check. Go as far down this
road as you dare (4WD is mandatory); the road ends very
near the creek. Carry down and put on the creek, or carry
downstream on the old roadbed on river left until the creek
widens a bit. When you get past the last big rapids, carry
back up the old road on river left. No shuttle required.
If you want an extended run, you can take out at the bridge
near Devils Den, just before the creek joins Lee Cr. It's
4.5 miles to the bridge and chock full of trees most of the
way. You can't say you weren't warned.  
 Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Strickler
Gradient: 180 fpm
Length: 0.25 to 0.5 mi. (or 5 mi. to Lee Cr.)
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: None. Only runnable soon after heavy local rainfall.  
 Drive to the put-in or the bridge near Lee to check the creek.
Hazards: tight and continuous rapids, overhanging limbs and strainers
Description: This small stretch of Ellis Br. was first run in November  
 1996 by Bill Herring and Randy Childers. The entire creek
is runnable, but the most challenging rapids are
encountered in the first 1/2 mile. After that point the
gradient diminishes and the trees close in - an
unpleasant combination. The uppermost part of the creek
is very, very narrow and steep, and with enough water (a
rare event) the rapids are continuous class III+ for 1/3
mile. After a couple of warm up drops, a large class
III+ staircase drop is encountered. After some serious
tree dodging there's another big drop. This rapid got
the name Runaway Rapid when Bill Herring dropped his boat
while portaging a tree on the steep left bank above the
rapid. The boat successfully made a first descent of the
rapid before it was extracted from the creek. This rapid
is actually a series of falls dropping more than 15 feet.
The right side of the second drop is a vertical pin
waiting to happen, and the last two drops are the largest
and fastest. Hit an eddy very quickly after Runaway  
 because a deadfall blocks the creek just around the
corner. After quite a bit of fast action another large
drop comes into view. This one consists of a fairly
straightforward single drop over a slanting rock. This
is the last of the big drops on the creek, and it may be
to bony to run if the water is not high. Unless the
creek is really roaring, it's probably a good idea to
pull out on the left just below Runaway, and start the
short drag back up to the car. If you go further down,
the gorge gets deeper, making it harder to carry out. As
a result of it's proximity of Fayetteville (35 min) and
the potential for a very short but exciting kayak run,
Ellis Br. makes a good one to catch when heavy midday
rains bring the creeks up but there's not enough
daylight for a longer run. All boaters should be good at
rock dodging in tight class III-IV rapids, and a flip
could be a very bruising experience. Pinning is par for
the course, but bank support for pinned paddlers is easy
to set up ahead of time on this ultra narrow creek.

Whistlepost Cr.
Rating: IV-V (P)
TDCR: 8995
Location: Whistlepost is entirely on private land, so be very careful
to not trespass on your way to the creek. The put-in is
reached by taking the Winslow exit off of I-540 and heading
East to Winslow. Just before you drop off the hill into
town, take a right on a good gravel road. This road is
Bunyard Rd. which eventually crosses over the freeway
tunnel. (It's also called Freedom Rd. at it's other end
that comes out near the Hart Cr. and Ben Doodle Cr.
put-ins. You can drive in from Chester that way too if you
prefer.) You'll need to make a right just outside of
Winslow and a left a while later. Just stay on the best
road surface if in doubt. After 4.5 to 5 miles of driving
you'll see a small road turning left with a sign for
"Morris Taxidermy". Take this road and take the
first left near a house (the taxidermy shop) about 1/4 mile
down. You'll go past some fields and finally come to a nice
gravel driveway leading to a house in a field. Turn right
at this driveway and follow the dirt road/trail downhill.
Unless you have a very high-clearance 4WD you'll want to
find a turnout to park in at this point. The road becomes
very rough. Either drive or walk downhill on this road
until you come to a large field on the right. Go just past
the field and look for a road/trail going left toward the
creek. Follow this road as it doubles back the way you came
and eventually paralells the bluffs of the creek gorge.
Stay on the road until it drops down into a timber cut and
intersects the creek. Put in on either of the two branches
which merge just downstream of the put-in. You're standing
right on the Washington/Crawford Co. line at the put in.
Don't try to access the put-in from the other side of the
creek (the left or East side). That road is gated (twice!)
and posted no trespassing! You can either take out on Clear
Cr. at Schaberg or at Chester. Schaberg is only 1/2 mile
down from the Whistlepost and Clear Cr. confluence, and it
can be reached by taking Schaberg Rd. from old Hwy. 71 at
the rest stop near Artist Point. Park on the near side
(river left) of the bridges at Schaberg to avoid annoying
landowners near the railroad tracks. Going to Chester adds
another 5 miles of class II-III water (about 1.5 hours when
Clear Cr. is high) to the trip and provides an easier to
find take-out.
Topo Quad(s): N/A
Gradient: 250 fpm (1 mi @ 350 fpm)
Length: 2.25 mi
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: This is a very small creek that needs very recent and heavy
rain to pump it up. 3" of rain no more than 6 hours
before you get there will probably produce a good run.
Clear Cr. and McCaslin Br. in Chester should be flooded,
and Lee Cr. should be heading for a reading of 15+ feet.
There are two tributaries converging right at the put-in.
Both should look at least a low-runnable level for a good
run. If the right trib is flowing over the road into the
left trib, the run will be very dangerous. No more than 200
cfs is needed for a solid class IV-V run!
Hazards: Numerous undercut rocks, downed trees, potholes, strong
hydraulics, big, continuous rapids.
Description: Whistlepost Cr. is probably the best and toughest of
Crawford Co. steep creek runs. In fact, its extreme
combination of gradient and huge undercut boulders packed
into a super-narrow gorge makes for one of the most
intense runs anywhere in the Ozarks. First run after a
freak summer storm on 6/30/99 by Bill Herring and Steve
Robertson, a little water goes a very long way in this
small gorge. Minimum, optimal, and high levels are only
seperated by a few cubic feet per second of flow. And this
is not a good creek to run when it's too high. The run
starts at a road crossing where two tributaries merge. The
first drops are a few easy class III's, which provide
little warmup for what's comming up. When you pass a
cascade comming in on the left, you'll be entering
"Wet Your Whistle", a 1/4 mile long stretch of
class III-IV that never seems to end. Good eddies are
really hard to find in this section, and there are some
places in it that you don't want to explore. Scout ahead
anytime you can get stopped. When you see a dark, cave
looking feature up ahead on the right, stop immediately
and get out on the left bank to scout
"Cathedral". This is one of the most difficult
and impressive rapids anywhere in the Ozarks. It consists
of four successive falls of four to ten feet in height.
The total drop is nearly 30 feet. Huge undercut rocks
overhang the rapid from the right, and water sieves into
and under these rocks in every drop. The third and
shortest drop is the most intense part, and you have to
work left fast after it to avoid an undercut and huge
pothole on the right. Scouting and portaging are possible
on river left. Next you'll have to get to the right bank
immediately below the last drop of Cathedral and scout
downstream to "Quiet Falls". Don't try to run
down to it from Cathedral, since there is not much
oppourtunity to stop before you drop over this 18 foot
fall. The scout or portage is on the right, and it is
extremely tough. It's a 10 to 15 minute trip one way to
get around the fall and the grotto that surrounds it.
Scout the pool carefully before trying to run Quiet Falls,
as wood tends to collect in the pool below. The pool is
about 6' at its deepest, and anywhere you land can hit you
really hard. The drop following the falls is fairly
straightforward on the right, but on the left it has one
of the worst undercuts in the Ozarks (nicknamed
"Wondercut"). If you run it, stay well to the
right. After this drop, scout ahead all the way to the
next big drop about 100 yards downstream. This is
"Big Nasty", which is not runnable by human
beings at normal levels. This combination
waterfall/natural bridge/undercut crevice is easiest to
portage on the left. If you get close to it, you'll likely
be running it, so pick out a good place to stop if you
choose to run the class III rapids just above. More class
III+ leads to a big class IV drop of about 10 feet. This
rapid tends to collect trees, so a portage on the right
may be the only good option. About 1/3 mile of
continuous, cluttered class III-IV water remains before
the creek eases up to class II-III. Don't let your gaurd
down in this stretch. After 1/3 mile of easier water,
you'll turn right and come along side a man-made rock pile
that has a railroad track on top of it. Get out and walk
downstream to scout "The Tunnel Of Love". This
6' culvert can be boated into Clear Cr., which runs on the
other side of the tracks. The drop into Clear Cr. is about
6 feet and the hydraulics at the bottom are bizzare and
could be dangerous. You'll most likely have to roll up
against the rock wall that the current pushes into right
at the bottom. Clear Cr. will seem huge after Whistlepost,
but it's considered a creek run in its own right. Clear
Cr. has lots of class II-III action and some really bad
trees right above the bridge at Schaberg. You can take out
at Schaberg (1/2 mile from Whistlepost) or you can run 5
more miles to Chester. If you go to Chester, watch out for
some more big culverts just past the I-540 bridges, and
beware of a rebar studded low-water crossing near some
ramshackle houses not too far below the freeway. (This
author will not run this section of Clear Cr. again, due
to holes punched into his creek boat by pieces of rebar!)
Whistlepost is an incredible steep creek run, and it is
one of the most dangerous runs around. It has more
undercuts in one mile than any other creek described in
this list! Scouting the creek dry ahead of time may be
a requirement for survival. (Besides it's as beautiful to
hike as it is to run!) If you've been down Hart Cr. and
thought it was no big deal, you'll probably enjoy
Whistlepost. If you don't have the skills to handle it,
you'll have a lot of hiking to do on your way out of the
gorge.

White R., West Fork
Rating: I-II (III)
TDCR: 2231
Location: Several put-ins and take-outs are possible. The river
follows Hwy. 71 between Winslow and West Fork. The uppermost
put-in is at the ball park in Winslow. Look for a gas station
with a gravel parking lot beside it. Park in the lot where
the wooden footbridge crosses the small creek. The next
public access point is the rest area on Hwy. 71 just north of
Brentwood. The next commonly used access is at a green steel
bridge, right beside a roadside cemetery, a few miles south of
West Fork. The usual lower take-out is at the park just
upstream of the Hwy. 170 bridge in West Fork. Park in the lot
on river left just upstream of the dam.
Topo Quad(s): Winslow, Brentwood, West Fork
Gradient: 15 fpm
Length: 12 mi.
Season: FALL, SPRING
Gauge: The White R. at Fayetteville should be 5 feet or higher
for a run from the green bridge to West Fork.  
 To gauge the river above that point, just inspect the river
from the road. At the wooden bridge in the ballpark at
Winslow, the rocks under the bridge should be just about
covered for a good run from that point.
Hazards: Occasional strainers, undercut at the second ledge
Description: The West Fork of the White is one of the most
accessible runs in the state, with a major highway following
almost the entire run. It comes up farily often, not
needing much rain to be runnable in its lower stretches.
It offers two class III rapids when it's high and a few nice
playspots. But the river is rarely run compared to other
rivers in the area. It's hard to guess why this is so,
but it sure makes for a pleasant trip down the river.
If the water is high, you can put in as high up as Winslow,
where the stream has continuous class II rapids and a very
narrow, twisting course. A straightforward class III ledge
is encountered just after putting in, and another class
III (IV on the left side?) ledge that pushes into an
undercut left bank is encountered a few miles down
under a red metal footbridge. Watch out for strainers
in this stretch - it's easy to get pushed into downed
trees. The rest stop, about 5 miles from Winslow,
is a better put-in if the level looks too low for Winslow.
In the next four miles, the creek picks up a lot of volume
until it becomes a river. Pools are longer, and rapids
in this stretch are generally in the class I and easy
II range with some tight corners and a few trees to dodge.
Just before the green bridge, additional water from Winn Cr.
pumps up the flow even more. This is a good put-in if the
water is low. Between the green bridge and West Fork there
are some fairly long pools, but a few ledgy class II drops
with some nice surfing opportunites make the trip worthwhile.
The bluffs on the right just above the dam offer some
beautiful scenery as well. Whatever you do, don't paddle over
the low head dam at West Fork! The hydraulic can kill, even
at moderate water levels. Take out upstream of the dam, or
walk around if you want to continue downstream. The West Fork
is suitable for beginning paddlers from the rest stop down,
and for paddlers who have a good deal of class II-III
experience from Winslow to the rest stop when the water is
high.

White Rock Creek
Rating: III-IV \*
TDCR: 8797
Location: To get to the take out drive west on I-40
turn at the Mulberry exit, go north on Hwy 215. Three miles
north one encounters the Mill Creek bridge; be sure to stop
and check the level. Continue north for about five miles
until Fern at which time 215 curves to the east continue
east three milestowards Shores Lake. There will be a sign,
"Shores Lake Campground" to the right, take it and go one mile
to the bridge crossing Hurricane Creek. This is the take-out.
For the put-in be sure to have the Bidville topo and a compass!
From the take-out follow Bliss Ridge Road north until it
"T's", take a left and go approxiamately one mile until you
see an unmaintained road to the left, drive about fifty
yards down it until you can find a parking place. This road
also serves as access to a hiking trail. You can either
follow the hiking trail down to the creek(1.5 mi.)or follow
the finger ridge down to the creek. It has a gentle slope
until you are about 100 feet over the creek and adds .5 mi.
of fun onto the run. If there is any doubt as to the level
of the creek...take the trail.
Topo Quad(s): Bidville
Gradient: 100 fpm (180 fpm in the first mile)
Length: 4.5 mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Check Mill and Little Mill creeks on the way up 215. They
should at the very least appear to be runnable. Hurricane
creek should appear to be flooded.
Hazards: Several undercuts on White Rock, strainers are present on
Hurricane but none to speak of on White Rock. As one nears
the conflence with Hurricane on White Rock there is some
tornado damage that produces some nasty downed trees and logs.
Walk around them! This section is noticable as the
creek appears to be clear-cut on either side, so there is
plenty of advance notice. These should wash out in the
coming years.
Description: White Rock Creek is a low-volume creek that runs off of
White Rock Mountain - well known by the White Rock Mountain
Recreation Area that sits on top of a big outcrop of Atoka
sandstone and affords a view unlike any in the
area (campsites and hiking trails etc.). Surprisingly the
first runnable mile only drops 180 feet, however it boasts
continuous III-IV rapids and falls that require previous
creeking expirience. There are many falls ranging from 12
to 6 feet in height and inumerable slides, chutes, boulder
gardens and the like. White Rock goes about three miles
through a deep canyon providing views from the creek
bottom that is some of the most beautiful scenery anywhere
in the Ozarks. About one half mile down the creek,
one enters a gorge marked by a two-tiered fall of
approxiamtely 15 feet. It is runnable as a broken
slide on the far right or two vertical drops that are
separated by an eddy just big enough to hold a couple of
kayaks. The right and left are preferred routes as there
is a pile of angular rocks at the center of the base.
After another quarter mile of countless drops there
appears an entrance to a slide with a large undercut
boulder on the right creating a large reaction wave, at
higher levels it could be dangerous to a swimmer (foot
entrapment) as the entire creek pushes against the base of
the rock where there is a slot horizontal to the creekbed
just wide enough to fit a swimmer's foot or leg. This
one is nicknamed Pizza Bone Rapid. Numerous rapids
follow until one comes to a slot (4 to 5 feet wide)
that is the entrance to a 10 to 12 foot near vertical
slide that ends in a pool surrounded on all sides by an
undercut bluff. Micah Adams aptly named it Punchbowl
Falls. After Punchbowl the creek runs along and under a
bluffline that creates a tapestry of cascading falls
running through hanging gardens of ferns and moss for
about 200 yards; as you paddle back and forth through the
mild rapids under the drip-line the feeling of isolated
wilderness is hard to ignore! Numerous rapids follow that
gradually lessen in intensity, and soon the gorge
ends. However, this does not mark the end of the fun as
there are several more six foot drops with a 10 to 12 foot
falls I like to think of as Skinnydip Falls (because it
has a nice pool and there is a trail in from the road to
access it). Not long after this one encounters the confluence
of Dry Fork and White Rock which is marked by a 5 to 6'
falls/drop on both drainages, Dry Fork Rapid. It may seem
to be an end to the whitewater but the paddler should not
grow complacent as soon one encounters a fall that may
produce a extremely nasty hydraulic at flood stage. This
consists of a fall that drops six feet over a sandstone
slab that is the most uniform falls I have ever seen; so
much so it appears to be man-made(no straight lines in
nature). This one is named Shower Curtain Falls because
one can easily paddle behind the veil and relax while
viewing the cascading water in a tunnel half sandstone,
half water. Five of us fit behind it with room to
spare. There are more rapids and drops until one nears
the confluence with Hurricane creek where a tornado
touched down and produced some nasty log jams, be prepared
to walk around them. Hurricane will be flooded, so one
should be very careful when approaching trees and strainers.
About a mile downstream, Hurricane the creek shoots into
and under a bluff. To all appearances from upstream it
doesn't look bad, but when viewing it up close
you can see an extremely undercut bluff that could be fatal
if you became trapped under it as the force of the entire
creek is flowing against it. The take-out is about .75 to
.5 miles downstream where you'll be glad to see Hurricane
Creek Bridge! White Rock Cr. is a good run, but it is very
isolated and it is certainly no place for those who are
not sure of their abilities on class IV water. White Rock
Cr. was first run on 10/6/98 by Micah Adams, Trey Marley,
Rob Pollan, Mike Echols and Steve "Dog" Robertson. Thanks
to Steve Robertson for the write up on this one!

Rating: II-IV
TDCR: 5563
Location: Howard Co.; Put in from Weyerhauser Rd. 52000 heading
west from 52200 east of the section 2 put-in for the
Cossatot. Take out at the Hwy. 4 bridge over Baker Cr.
just east of the Cossatot bridge.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Baker Springs
Gradient: 75 fpm
Length: 3.5 mi
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: The Corps gauge for the Cossatot should be between
2000 and 4500 cfs.
Hazards: several large drops in the first mile, some strainers
Description: Baker is a short but exciting advanced whitewater run.
It drops very steeply in the first mile, and the worst
drop is encountered in the first bend of the creek. This is
a solid class IV ledge of over ten feet, and at high water
an ugly hydraulic forms at the base of the ledge. Scout
and/or run it on the left. After some good class III water,
you get another horizon line. This is another big, tough
ledge that is only slightly easier than the first one.
After the first 3/4 mile or so the creek settles into
some good class II-III action until the takeout. All boaters
should be confident on fast class III-IV water before running
Baker Cr. If you get nervous at Cossatot Falls then this
run will probably be over your head.

North Fork Of Blakely Cr.
Rating: II
TDCR: ????
Location: Hot Springs County. Take exit 91 (Social Hill) off I-30 and
head east on Hwy 84 about 3 miles then turn left on county
road 13 (830 in the Delorme Atlas) just before the store on
the left. After the road turns to dirt it's about 1/4 mile
turn left 50 yds. to the takeout; to get to the put-in go
back to CR 13 and turn left when the main road turns right
stay straight until the road makes a sharp left and you're
there.
Topo Quad(s): N/A
Gradient: N/A
Length: 1.5 mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: There should be at least 6 inches of water over the low
water bridge at the put-in for the creek to be runnable.
You will cross over the main fork of Blakely Creek between
the exit and the turn on the county road if it's not high
and muddy the water's probably too low.
Hazards: Downed trees
Description: The first 3/8 of a mile has numerous 1-3 feet drops
separated by short pools with fast current and some waves.
One rapid about 1/4 of a mile from the put-in is a double
drop and the clear path on the first drop doesn't line up
with the second drop path quick maneuvering is required.
After you go through Car Cruncher (there's a crunched car
on the right bank) beware of downed trees. Then after you
go through a channel in the willows barely wide enough for
a kayak the rapids lose intensity and the pools get longer
until right before the takeout where there's a 2 foot drop
followed by 50 yds. of waves. The creek is never very far
from the road and it could be floated into the Main Fork
of Blakely Creek and use Hwy 84 as a takeout. Don't expect
a large volume of water on this swift narrow stream
unless you float into the main fork. Thanks to

Camp Cr.
Rating: IV+ _
TDCR: ????
Location: Take Hwy. 70 west from Hot Springs, then take Hwy. 4
north just before you get to Dierks. Go about 7 miles
until you reach the Blue Ridge Campgound access. Go past
this point and take the first dirt road on the left.
Go about one mile until you see a tin barn on the right.
Directy accross from this barn is a small road that
leads to a camping spot. Camp Creek Falls is only
30 feet from the campping area. Other put-ins and
take-outs may be possible.
Topo Quad(s): N/A
Gradient: N/A fpm
Length: N/A mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Visual gauge at the Falls. If the Little Missouri R.
gauge at Langley is very high, that may be a good
indication as well.
Hazards: Vertical pins at the falls if you dont boof.
Description: This description only covers Camp Creek Falls, a
12 to 13 foot plunge on the creek. There may be other
rapids worth running, but, so far, scouting the
creek near the Falls hasn't turned up much. The
Falls has two possible lines, both of which have "S"
turns at the top. Both also land on a foam pile
with a grabby hole at the bottom. The Falls were first
run on Nov. 6, 2000 on river right by Jason Mellor,
John McCoy, and Heath Day. Jason also ran the river
left line that day, which is a bit more difficult.
The Falls is about 20 minutes from the Cossatot
and Little Missouri, and is worth checking out
if you're in the area after a big rain!

Location: Polk and Howard Co.;
S1: Put in at the Hwy. 246 bridge east of Hwy 71. Take out
is reached by taking Weyerhauser Rd. 52200 south
from Hwy. 246 just east of the put-in. Then take
52000 west to reach the river.
S2: Take out at Ed Banks bridge on Weyerhauser Rd 52600
which runs north from Hwy. 278 (used to be Hwy. 4)
and connects with 52200 coming south from Hwy. 246.
S3: Take out at the low water bridge downstream from the
Hwy. 278 bridge.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Eagle Mountain, Baker Springs
Gradient: 15 to 25 fpm (the Falls area is a major exception)
Length: S1: 3 mi
S2: 1.5 mi
S3: 4.5 mi
Season: RAIN
Gauge: The minimum level on the USGS gauge at Vandervoort is
around 3.2 feet. The Falls can be run down to 3.0 or so, but
the rest of the river starts getting really bony below 3.5. The
river is much pushier and the Falls starts to go into the solid
class IV+ range somewhere above 5.0 feet. The river has been run
by crazed adrenaline junkies up to over 10 feet, but the Falls
is very scary for even the best of boaters at anything over 7 feet!
LINK TO USGS GAUGE
Hazards: Big, continuous drops in the Falls area, and very heavy water
in S2 and S3 when levels are high.
Description: The Cossatot is probably the premier whitewater run in
Arkansas. S1 consists of mostly class II rapids and is
suitable for boaters with a little experience on whitewater.
However, if you don't have much experience, don't venture
below S1! The action picks up considerably in S2 with rapids
like ZigZag and The Esses. ZigZag is an easy class III
drop, and enders are possible in the hole below if the water
is high. The Esses is a long, complex class III rapid, and
the penalty for a mistake in this rapid could be a long and
bruising swim! To avoid the big stuff, you can start center-left
and work your way to the right toward several eddies along the
right bank. There are a couple of solid holes in the middle of
the run to pick your way past. A few more good rapids are
encountered before you come to the Sandbar bridge where
the final section of the river begins. Portage the bridge on
the left - don't get near the middle of the bridge as it is
extremely hazardous. Only a few hundred yards below the Sandbar
bridge, the Cossatot Falls section begins. This is a series of
back-to-back class III-IV rapids that drops around 40 feet in 1/8
of a mile. The first of these is a big class II+ drop followed by
a pool at most levels. The next drop, Eye Opener, presents the
paddler with a horizon line. At lower levels, the hole below this
three foot ledge is not too bad, but at levels of over 5.0 feet,
it can be a keeper! Scout if there is any doubt. Below this
the river is pushed to the left into B.M.F. a tricky class
III drop. This one is generally run angling to the left and
dodging the hidden rock in the middle. Be sure to catch an
eddy below B.M.F. because the Washing Machine is just below.
The Machine is a class IV drop at almost any level. At levels
below 4.5 feet, it must be approached from the right side.
Running almost perpendicular to the streambed, enter the drop,
turn right and hit the middle of the slot to finish. It's
easy to make the turn too tight and end up on the right
where the Cannonball Rock lurks at low water levels and
where the Washing Machine Hole will take you to the cleaners
at medium flows. At high water, you can approach from the
center or even the left and run straight over the top of
the drop. If you have trouble in the Machine, your troubles
will be compounded by Whiplash, a long class III+ drop right
below the Machine. At high water levels, it's a great idea
to set some rope support on the left bank at strategic
locations between B.M.F. and Whiplash, since an unassisted
swimmer will get flushed through all of these - a bruising
ride. Needless to say, having a reliable roll is also an
excellent idea. The Falls ends with Shoulderbone, a class II
drop with a pretty good play hole at lower levels. At certain
flows even bigger boats can get enders in the hole here.  
 Several good rapids are encountered below the Falls, but if
you had a clean run in the Falls only two will give you any
trouble. The first is Deer Camp Rapids, an easy looking
class III that can pin unwary boaters. The other is Devil's
Hollow Falls. This ugly sheer fall has a nasty landing on
jagged rocks that have taken skin off of more than a few
boaters. Pins and entrapments are a real danger in this
rapid, and some close calls have happened here. Don't run
the ledge unless you know exactly what you're doing.
You can walk or sneak around Devil's Hollow Falls on the
far left. At lower levels, it's a long, relatively flat,
paddle to the takeout from Devil's Hollow. If the river
is below 3.5 feet, many boater will run Cossatot Falls
and then carry back up the bank rather than continuing
down to the Hwy. 278 bridge. It's about an equal effort
either way though - the trek back up the Falls is not for
the meek! The Cossatot is a great whitewater river, but
be sure you're up to the challenge before you try to boat
down the Falls. A lot of folks, including this author, have
been beaten up by this infamous stretch of river. Only boaters
with solid self rescue skills and experience on pushy class
IV water should attempt the Falls.

Crooked Cr.
Rating: III-IV (V)
TDCR: 7771
Location: Go about 2 miles north of Albert Pike on CR4 until
you come to CR1. Take CR1 about anther 2 miles until
the creek goes under the road. This is the takeout.  
 There are campsites there that you can use to park.
Continue up CR1 until you get to the Little Missouri
Falls turn off - this is the putin for the lower gorge.
To get to the put in for the upper gorge keep following
CR1 until you come to a low water bridge that is not crossable,
park here and ferry across the creek. Carry your boat .5
to .75 miles up the road to the next low water bridge. Put in
at that point for the upper gorge. The creek runs right by
the road the entire time so scouting on the way up is possible.
At the time of this writing in Spring of 2001, the section
of the creek between the Backbreaker Falls and the lower gorge
is completely full of downed trees from a massive ice storm.
You will probably just want to skip this whole section
and shuttle back down from the big falls to the put-in for
the lower section.
Topo Quad(s): N/A
Gradient: 115 fpm (275 fpm max)
Length: 3 mi
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Little Missouri at Langley should be at least 7.5 for the
lower section and 9.5 for the upper gorge. The only way to be
sure is visual inspection of the creek.
Hazards: Large falls, undercuts, strainers, continuous rapids, etc.
Description: The first run of Crooked Cr. was by Chris Anderson
in January 1995, when all but a couple of drops were run. Chris
returned in January of 1997 and ran all of the drops at that
time. The upper gorge consists of 5 or 6 waterfalls ranging
5 to 10 feet in height. These falls all occur in less than 100
yards. After this the creek makes a left turn followed by
several slide/ledge drops before it slows down a little
before the low water bridge. Thanks to the ice storm the
upper gorge is not runnable at the time of this writing.
Just below the low water bridge is Back Breaker Falls, a
class IV+ to V drop. Trees tend to accumulate near or in the
drop, so watch out for them. The only good line on this
drop is the far right. If you get into the middle of the
falls, you will hit a launching pad that can send you flying
onto an extremely shallow shelf 18 to 20 feet below! If you
stay on the right side line, you can run down on a seam just
big enough to put a boat down. It's a great ride if you make
the line - a real banger if you don't. As of June 2001, you'll
need to portage (shuttle) from the pool below the falls to
the start of the lower section near Little Missouri Falls.
Eventually the dozens of downed trees in this section will
not be a problem, but it will take several years for that to
happen. The lower section starts of with some class II+
rapids, and then a definite horizon line appears. This is
the start of Double Ledges - a solid class III rapid. Start
on the far left and run the slot working your way right into
a seam about half way down. The next bridge you go under marks
the start of the lower gorge. All of the water pushes to the
right, but head for the eddy on the left to scout the drops.
There are several different lines through this tight, class IV
section of whitewater, but only one way out at the bottom.  
 Pick the line that suits you best, but be on target when you
reach the final drops. At the bottom of the gorge there
is a 6 to 8 foot waterfall with a boofing pad just right
of center. Make sure you hit the boof because the pool is
shallow! Several bows have been smashed here due to wayward
lines. A few more class II rapids brings you to another
bridge - the entrance to the last rapid. This solid
class III drop provides several broaching and pinning
possibilities. Take out at the bottom of this rapid
and head to the Little Missuori for some big water
play boating! This little creek is certainly one of the
most beautiful and exciting runs in the state. Scout
it carefully from the road and make sure you are up to
the challenge before tackling the drops. Thanks to Heath
Day and Lance Jones for information on this great run.

DeRoach Cr.
Rating: II-III _
TDCR: ????
Location: Put-in: Highwy 283 bridge. Plenty of parking just before
bridge on the right coming from Arkadelphia. Take-out:
Highway 67 bridge, either side. There's a nice place to
park at the bridge. There are cows and a nice fence on the
right and a little incline on the left. Take your pick. It
seems to be friendly teritory, but you never know these
days.
Topo Quad(s): Caddo Valley
Gradient: 20 fpm (65 fpm max)
Length: 6 mi
Season: RAIN
Gauge: Guage on Hwy 283 bridge. Any thing above 3 feet is runnable.
Up to 6 or 7 becomes a much tougher run. Above that the run is
severely flooded.
Hazards: Trees and strainers. An ugly triple set of culverts that
proceed through a low water bridge are usually clogged with debris
Also at the take out watch for slick cow patties. :-)
Description: The run starts out with about 3.4 miles of moving flat
water. The good stuff starts at A\*_-hole Culverts, which should
be portaged. There are a number of good surf waves just
downstream of the culverts but the meat of the run begins as
you notice the walls of the ridge rising. Rock House Rapid is
a nice III rapid, sometimes presenting difficulty when
trees or debree collect in the boulders. The rapid can also
be run right from the very top where the rocks are split by
an island. A few hundred yards downstream is a nice
continuous field of waves and holes called "Fitz-Cha
Rapids". You might want to stay river right the first time
you run this one, because half way down there's a BIG hole
left of center. (Note: The hole very deceptive from up top
and based on personal experience, it will hold you untill
the water level drops. You will then be nearing I-30, and
Meatface Rapids, which is the best section of class III
rapids, depending on the level. This section is about
several hundred yards of continuous drops, holes, and waves.
If you can find a path back up to the top, I recomend running
this section twice. Just below the interstate is the last
good rapid which can be run straight on. This one ends
with a nice surf wave, once again depending on the level.
Be warned that this is a narrow, fast paced creek run
full of numerous strainers and other hazards. Because it
is so tight, there is a lot of difference between 3 ft
on the gauge and 6 ft. Anyone who can't hit an eddy on a
dime has no business being on the creek when the water's
good, despite what you might hear from paddlers who have run
it at low levels. Thanks to Rob Fisher and Lance Jones
for information on this run.

Gutter Rock Cr.
Rating: III+ _
TDCR: ????
Location: Logan Co.; Take Hwy 23 south of I-40 at Mulberry the
take Hwy 309 to Paris. From there, all I can remember is
that it's below the north face of Mt. Magazine on a road
labeled 1631C on the topo quads. Find the Cove Cr.
confluence and put in on the road 2 mi. above that.
Take out on another dirt road 1 mile below Cove Cr. on
Short Mtn. Cr. Shuttle is on the river left side of the creek.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Blue Mountain, Paris
Gradient: 100 fpm.
Length: 3 mi.
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Only runnable after extremely heavy rainfall. You may be
able to estimate when Gutter Rock is up by checking the flows
on Dutch Cr. and Pettit Jean at Booneville. When Dutch Cr.
is running 1000 cfs (7.0 ft) or more and Pettit Jean is running
several thousand cfs (12+ ft), Gutter Rock and Shoal Cr. are
probably runnable (that day at least!). Also, check the rainfall
gauge at Blue Mtn. Dam. Over 1.5 inches of recent rain is a good
indicator. You can find these gauges on the ACC Bulletin
Board.
Hazards: heavy strainers, continuous rapids
Description: This creek was first run by Tom Lewis, Cowper Chadbourn,
C. Chevalier, Jim McDaniel, Chris Anderson, Nathan Kline
and Paul Caldwell in Dec. 1993. It is very tight and fast
paced, and contains numerous class III+ rapids. The
gradient is spread out very evenly over the 3 mile run.  
 Some of the tougher drops are encountered in a small gorge just
above the confluence with Cove Cr. After this confluence you
are on Short Mtn. Cr. which may be boated past the above
mentioned take out. This creek has been described as
comparable to Shoal Cr. I've just seen it dry, so thanks
to Tom Lewis and Cowper Chadbourn for the info. on this one.  
 Gutter Rock should only be attempted by advanced boaters,
due to the heavy whitewater and the remoteness of the run.

Jack Cr.
Rating: II-III
TDCR: 4442
Location: To reach the take-out, take Hwy 23 south from Booneville
aprrox 1.5 miles and turn left on Jack Cr. Rd. going toward
Grayson and Jack Cr. Recreation Area. The road will eventually
turn to gravel. At the next four way intersection, turn
left (East) onto a paved road. Follow this road downhill to
Jack Cr. Rec. Area and the bridge over Sugar Cr. Jack Cr.
Campgorund is the take-out. To reach the put-in, go over
the bridge over Sugar Cr. and follow this road to the next
bridge which crosses Jack Cr. You can either put in at this
bridge or take one of the small dirt roads to the left
(West) which will take you up to Ramsey or Pigeon Cr. and
add a few miles of class II+ water to the run if the water
is high. The creek is only one hour from Fort Smith and
Russellville, so it's a great afternoon run for paddlers in
these areas.
Topo Quad(s): Sugar Grove, Freedom Mountain
Gradient: 65 fpm
Length: 3 mi
Season: RAIN
Gauge: One possible way to gauge Jack Cr. is to look at the USGS
Petit Jean R. gauge at Booneville. If this gauge is reading over
10 feet there should be enough water for a good run, unless
rain was spotty. Also look at Dutch Creek at Waltreak. A
reading of 6.0 or better can be a good indication of water
on Jack and Sugar Cr. Typically Jack Cr. takes a bit more
rain than Sugar Cr., and about 1.5"+ in the area is a good
indication that it will be comming up. When you get to Sugar Cr.,
water comming over the low water bridge at Knoppers Ford
usually means you'll have enough for a run on Jack Cr.
Hazards: Willow strainers, downed trees, and hydraulics at high
levels
Description: Jack Cr. is a great little creek run in the Ouachita
Mountains. The scenery along the creek is superb! The creek
races between intricately layered and folded bluffs as it
appraches its confluence with Sugar Cr., creating
fast-paced class II and III rapids and taking the paddler
through some of the most interesting scenery in the state.
Surfing oppourtunities abound, with several nice waves and
holes to catch on the way down. Watch out for willow
strainers in a few places that can pin paddlers who
misjudge the fast currents flowing through them. However,
the trees aren't usually as bad as those on Sugar Cr.,
so if the creeks are high, Jack is a much better choice.
At high levels, also watch out for a couple of chutes
into really big hydraulics! If you want to extend your
run, you can follow the small roads upstream from the
put-in bridge that lead to Ramsey Cr. or Pigeon Cr.
Pigeon Cr. is extremely small, and Jack Cr. must be
very high before Pigeon Cr. will be running. The rapids
in these two creeks are not really any more challenging
than Jack Cr., but the stream beds are narrow (especially
Pigeon Cr.!) and the gradient is steeper. If Jack Cr. is
too bony, try Sugar Cr. upstream of the Jack Cr.
confluence, a good class II+ to III run when Jack Cr. is
too low to boat.

Jimmy Cr.
Rating: III-IV _
TDCR: 5472
Location: Jimmy Cr. is located in Comanche Co., OK in the Wichita
Mts. Take Hwy. 58 until there is a sign that says "Meers
4 miles". At the sign take a left. Set your car to take out
at Lake Lawtonka. Firther up the road, you will pass
over the creek just before Meers Cafe. At the next stop
sign take a right. About fifty yards up the road is
the put-in. Jimmy Cr. confluences with Medicine Cr. after
about 1.25 mi, then it is about two miles to the take out
at Lake Lawtonka.
Topo Quad(s): Pg. 50 of OK Gazeteer Qd. E-3
Gradient: 100 fpm
Length: 3 mi
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Optimal is about 4" of water over the put-in bridge, but the creek
can be run with even less water. Quite a bit of rain is needed
to bring this creek up.
Hazards: There are a few hazards to keep an eye out for. Strainers
are thick on this creek, so watch for them. The bridge
before Meers had two of three channels blocked with debris
on the first run. Narrow channels and technical moves are
the mainstay of this run, and vertical pins are a possibility
at Chocolate Thunder.
Description: Jimmy Cr. was first run on Oct. 23, 2000 by Dave Borrel
and Terry DeMoe. The run is best described as a very fun
and continuous creek run with class III-IV rapids. The
first rapid comes about thirty yards into the run. Sugar
Mama (III) drops three feet with a glassy wave below it.
The next rapid is Snicker Doodle (II+) featuring three
and four foot waves, cutting to the right. Then comes the
bridge, so eddy out on river left and make sure the channel
is clear before running or consider a portage. Immediatly
after the bridge is Porcupine (III+). This rapid runs through
trees, and there are several precise cuts you must make in
to complete the drop. Choclate Thunder (III+) is a five
ft. drop with a narrow slot to hit. In the center of the creek,
the first descent paddlers both hit a rock at the bottom of the
drop. A good boof may be needed to keep your bow up as you go
over the top. Little Thunder (III) is a three foot drop
followed by a wave train. After this the river cuts to the
right again. Eddy out left to scout the next rapid,
Twisted Cedar (IV). This is a double drop with a right
entrance. Stay right and be ready for a left draw as you
hit the second drop. The last rapid is Twisted Sister (III+)
a four ft. drop on the right. There are several vines hanging
into the water here and the current pushes into them, so be
careful. About fifty yards later Jimmy Cr. runs into
Medicine Cr. (II-III). There is much more flat water on
Medicine, but towards the end there are three good class
III rapids (Apache, Comanche, and Geronimo). Although
Jimmy is only a mile and a quarter run, it is packed with
great rapids. It is well worth checking out, but make sure
you're experienced with tight class III+ rapids before you
make the trip.

Little Missouri R.
Rating: II-III
TDCR: 4445
Location: Polk, Montgomery, and Pike Co.; Put in is at Albert Pike
Campground reached by taking Hwy. 369 north from Hwy. 84
at Langley. The take out is at the Hwy. 84 bridge west
of Langley.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Big Fork, Polk Cr. Mountain, Athens
Gradient: 35 fpm (?)
Length: 8.5 mi
Season: RAIN
Gauge: A minimum of 27 inches of airspace is needed at the Albert
Pike low-water bridge. When water is lapping against the
bottom of this bridge, the run will be severely flooded and
solid class III-IV.
Hazards: Willow strainers, hydraulics at high levels
Description: This pristine stream is one of the prettiest in the
Ouachitas. The run contains some class III rapids at any
level, and some of the biggies may be pushing class IV
when the water is high. The Winding Stairs (III) is a series
of four good drops in quick succession, and Edgar's Ledge
(III) can flex it's muscles at medium to high water. Take
time to drive a few miles north of Albert Pike to the Little
Missouri Falls area. These drops are almost always
too shallow to run, but the last one may be runnable if the
water is extremely high. All boaters should be competent on
class III water if the level is low, and only solid class IV
boaters should tackle the run at higher flows. If you
don't fall into either one of these categories, you can put
in at the Hwy. 84 bridge and float through some good class II
water for 11 miles down to the bridge at U.S. 70.

Ouachita River At Rockport
Rating: II
TDCR: ????
Location: You can float the river by launching just below Remmel Dam,
take US Hwy 270 east from Malvern to Jones Mill. Turn left
onto Remmel Dam road and follow to the river. Or you can
drive to the I-30 Bridge crossing and paddle 1/4 mile
upstream to the ledge. Recently the road on the north side
has been opened and it may be possible to drive directly to
the ledge. To park under the I-30 Bridge cross the river on
I-30 going west and exit immediately, cross over and turn
left at the old Tanner Street Bridge to cross private
property to the I-30 Bridge access.
Topo Quad(s): Malvern North
Gradient: N/A (just one rapid)
Length: N/A (5 mi. from dam to I-30)
Season: ALL
Gauge: USGS Ouachita River Gage at Jones Mill, river is typically
up or down. Optimum surfing at the ledge is 3,600 cfs which
is full flow generation from the dam.
Hazards: No major hazards beyond the typical underwater rocks and
swift water. There is excellent recovery if you should swim
while playing.
Description: There is a river wide ledge that creates a number of Class
II play spots. This is a good location for beginners to
learn to ferry and roll and for more advanced paddlers to
play when nothing else is running. During the week you can
call Entergy at 501-844-2148 and ask if Remmel Dam is
generating. Note that it requires 3 hours for the water to
fully develop at the ledge after generation starts. During
the late summer the dam may only run for 3 hours. The dam
typically operates during the peak energy load demand
which is late afternoon in the summer so this makes an
ideal after work opportunity for those in the Little Rock
and Hot Springs areas. Thanks to Ted Smethers for information
on this great summertime playspot.

Saline R.
Rating: II-III _
TDCR: ????
Location: Howard Co.; Put in below Shady Lake on Hwy. 84 west
of Athens. Take out at Hwy. 246 bridge north of Athens.
Area Map
Topo Quad(s): Umpire
Gradient: 50 fpm
Length: 3 mi
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Water should be running over Shady Lake Dam near the put-in.
Also, other runs nearby should be in flood.
Hazards: strainers and very fast current
Description: This is a fast, continuous class II+ run with some
class III+ hazards created by downed trees. All boaters
need to have very good boat control, since catching an
eddy in the fast current could mean the difference between
a good run and a very bad one. Otherwise, the run is fast
and fun with continuous gradient. Boaters should be very
comfortable on class II-III water and very familiar with
the dangers of strainers before attempting this run.

Lower Saline R.
Rating: II+ (play waves)
TDCR: ????
Location: Below Dierks Lake at USCOE Campground. Follow the signs to
Dierks Lake Dam from Hwy 70 just West of the town of
Dierks. Play the 3/4 mile horseshoe bend around the
campground. This area contains the best play spots.
Topo Quad(s): N/A
Gradient: ?? fpm
Length: 3/4 mi
Season: DAM CONTROLLED - usually releases occur during drawdown in early fall
Gauge: The USGS gauge on the Saline R. near Dierks. The new features seem to be playable
from 6 ft up to maximum flow from the spillway (somewhere
around 10 or 11 ft). This gauge is several miles downstream
from the features and it seem to take 4-5 hours for the
water to travel that far and for the gauge to show a
release.
Click here for the Corp gauge for the lake. Notice
the min pool level. If below this, the river won't run.
Click here for the gauge at the spillway/pipe. This
updates every four hours or so. It is a faster indicator than the
USGS guage, which is 5 miles down stream.
Hazards: N/A
Description: This is a really nice area that is perfect for
park and play. There is a wooded campground with 8-10
sites with blacktop roads, level, gravel parking pads, a
restroom with flush toilets and a pavilion. The loop is
about 3/4 of a mile long and shuttle can be walked (about
a 1/4 mile). There are a couple of natural class I-II
rapids in the loop besides the 3 features that were built
with the COE in July, 2004. These features are at the
bottom of the loop, just down from the campground. The
first one is a small, glassy wave (about 1.5ft tall) with
a good eddy on the right. The second feature is an
aggressive hole that is more surfable on river right, and
more trashy on river left. Eddies on both sides, with the
eddie on the right being a little more user friendly.
Several people have swum out of this hole, but all with
smiles on their faces and with little to no recirculation
once the boater and the boat separate. The third feature
is a large frothy wave/hole (about 4 ft tall) with nice
eddies on both sides. This hole has a clean washout and is
not as nasty as it first appears. The size intimidates
newer paddlers but can be fun for everyone. Any trick you
want to throw can be attempted here. Just below at the
takeout by the swimming area is the last rapid. A class
II with a couple of small surfing spots. Eddy service is
not as good for these. Currently there is only one scheduled
release that happens the first or second weekend in October.
The rest of the time it will only run several days after a
good rain. This is a flood control lake and they actually
hold water back to help out down stream and release
several days later when things downstream drop down.

South Fourche La Fave R.
Rating: II+
TDCR: 2234
Location: The uppermost put-in is the USFS campground at Hollis on Hwy. 7.
The bottom take-out is near Aplin at the Deberrie low water
bridge. To get to the take-out from the west, drive towards
Aplin on Hwy. 60. Just before Aplin, Hwy. 155 runs south and
crosses the Fouche. There is a dirt road that veers off to
the right immediately after the bridge and follows the Fourche.
Follow this road and keep bearing right and you will get
to the take out bridge. It’s near the Deberrie cemetary, and
it's a fairly big concrete low-water bridge with several culverts
in the middle. If the middle culverts are 1/2 to 2/3 full, you’ll
have good water. If the river is over the bridge, it’s probably too
high for safe paddling. To get to the put-in at Hollis, get back on
Hwy. 60 and head east to Fourche Junction. Take Hwy. 7 south
toward Hot Springs and put-in at the USFS campground just south
of the bridge at Hollis.
Topo Quad(s): Nimrod
Gradient: ???
Length: 11 mi.
Season: RAIN
Gauge: The USGS Hollis gauge should be at 3.5 for a runnable level.
4-5 ft is optimal, and 6 ft and up may be dangerous due to
log jams and meanders. Put in at Cedar Creek lake dam when
the creek is higher to avoid the log jams.
Hazards: Log jams and pushy water when high. Also the low water
bridge at the take out has culverts that must be avoided.
Description: The first part of the river is pretty tame. The S.
Fourche tends to be pretty brown from runnoff due to farms
above Hollis, but the scenery is good. As the river just
bumps along, you can look around and see Forked Mountain
in the distance. After about a third of the way through the
trip, the river braids and breaks into several branches
through a tangle of trees and flotsam. This spot is about a half
mile past a cabin on river left. The first river left branch
appears to be the best as there’s only one nasty, gown-up
area you have to pick a line through. Keep to the left as
you work through the first part and then right at the bottom.
You want to be pretty careful through this mess to avoid pinning
on a tree. Eventually, the river runs back into one channel,
runs into a large hillside as it turns left and Cedar Cr.
comes in from river right. Cedar Cr. makes a good alternate
put-in at high water levels (put-in at Cedar Cr. Lake below the
dam by taking FR 86 off of Hwy. 7 just south of Hollis, then
go north on FR 29150 through a clear cut until you get to
an intersection, and follow the small road that runs northeast and
uphill to the dam). About 200 yards downstream from Cedar Cr. is
the first significant rapid (class II+), called "Blockhead"
because it features a large blocky boulder on river right that
much of the water funnels into. Above the rock and in the
middle of the flow is another smaller rock that must be
missed. When water is flowing over the rock, it makes for a
nice "boof" move. Below this rapid, you can play in the jet and
eddylines caused by Blockhead Rock. A half mile below Blockhead,
another rapid appears as you approach a rocky hogback ridge
that cuts into the river from the left. This rapid has no
real obstacles but is fun, fast water. This is a spot to
appreciate how unique the scenery on the S. Fourche is.
It looks like no other river in Arkansas, as it cuts through
the rocky and sparesely vegetated east/west Ouachita ridges. If
you paddle the river in winter, the barren slopes are reminicient
of the desert runs in the West. The midpoint of the trip comes
at one of the few roads that crosses the river, FR 210.
There's no bridge, but you can see an old concrete tower on river
left: the USGS Hollis gaging station. There's a big willow jungle
right below the road, with the best line at middle-right. A few
hundred yards below the jungle is a large, bald ridge on river
right that is very scenic. The action picks up again as Cove Cr.
approaches. There’s a nice rapid, known as "Bounce Rapid" just above
Cove Cr. with several eddies and then a small drop at the end.
Soon after the entry of Cove creek the river runs into another
ridge and sharply turns to the east. After this point, the S.
Fourche slows and become a pastoral stream. There are a few more
rapids but not any that really demand attention. Soon, the
river cuts back to the north between a ridge and empties into the
Fourche Valley. There’s a great surfing rapid about 3/4
mile before the take out. It’s created by a ledge that’s
pretty sharp on river left but smoothes out on river
right. It creates a nice side surfing hole on left that’s
easy to get into and a lot of fun to play. The S. Fourche is
often overlooked by paddlers, but it is one of the more scenic
and interesting streams in the state. It has a true wilderness
feel and the unusual scenery makes up for a somewhat murky water
quality. If you’re looking for continuous whitewater, this river
isn’t for you, but it's a fine run for those wanting to explore
a new class II+ river. Thanks to T. Yamashita for information on
this great run!

Sugar Cr.
Rating: III
TDCR: 5543
Location: To reach the take-out, take Hwy 23 south from Booneville
aprrox 1.5 miles and turn left on Jack Cr. Rd. going toward
Grayson and Jack Cr. Campground. Follow the signs for Jack
Creek Recreation Area. The road will eventually turn to
gravel and then you'll come to a four-way intersection. Turn
left (East) onto a paved road. Follow this road downhill to
Jack Cr. Rec. Area and the bridge over Sugar Cr. The recreation
area is the takeout. To reach the put-in, go back the way you
came, uphill, to the four-way intersection and hang a left
(South). After you go back downhill to the creek, you'll
come to the low water bridge at Knoppers Ford Campground.
If water is over this bridge, CHECK IT CAREFULLY before
attempting to cross it! If you can't cross here, the creek
is flooded - turn around and run Jack Cr. instead! Otherwise
cross this low water bridge and keep driving to the next low
water bridge. Stop here and make sure you mark this dangerous
bridge so that you can eddy out well above it. A 10 minute
hike up the bank to mark an eddy can save your life! Then
cross the bridge and drive until you reach the third low
water bridge. This is the ususal put in point. The creek
can be boated above this point in high water, but there's
plenty of action for most folks below this bridge!
Topo Quad(s): Sugar Grove, Freedom Mountain
Gradient: 45 fpm (first 2 miles @ 65 fpm)
Length: 6 mi
Season: RAIN
Gauge: The USGS gauge for the Petit Jean R. at Booneville should
generally be reading over 9 feet for a good run. Dutch Creek
at Waltreak may be an even better indicator: a reading of
5.0 or better usually means there is water in Sugar Cr.
If both of these gauges are looking good, it's a done deal!
There is a hand painted gauge on one of the concrete bridge
supports on the downstream side of the Sugar Cr. bridge at
the take-out near Jack Cr. Rec. Area. 1 foot on this gauge is
a good minimum for Sugar Cr. 1.5 is starting to cook and there
will be some fast class III action. 2.0 is a solid class III
level and quite pushy (also the upstream bridges have some water
over them at this level). If you can't see any marks at all,
the creek will be in flood - rapids will be long, constant
class III to IV with little hope of dodging the trees or
finding eddies. Insane hairboaters may have fun at this level,
but most folks will want to check out Jack Cr. which will
also be pumped way up to class III+ levels.
Hazards: An incredible amount of trees! Also the most dangerous
low water bridge in Arkansas (2.5 miles from the put-in)
and several cables hanging into the creek about 1/4 mile
above Knoppers Ford! Did I mention the trees? Also some
nasty hydraulics at high water levels. And trees.
Description: Maybe the best way to describe the character
of the Sugar Cr. run is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. At lower
levels (below 1.4 on the take-out bridge) Sugar Cr. is
a mostly straightforward class II play run with dozens
of anoying trees and willow jungles. Boaters who see the
creek at this level usually come away thinking, "what's the
big deal - it's like a fast version of the Mulberry!" But
at around 2.0 on the take-out bridge gauge the creek leaves
an entirely different impression. At this level, rapids
are often compared to drops on the Ocoee R. in Tennessee.  
 Holes become things to be avoided rather than surfed. And
the "annoying" trees become serious threats to life and limb.
At high levels, really good boaters can find themselves
blown into, over, and under the myriad trees before they
can get stopped. And there are also the man-made hazards:
low water bridges and old cables hanging in the river.
Luckily, the creek has an automatic system for warning
boaters when they're about to get in over their heads:
if you can't cross the low water bridges to make it to
the put-in, you don't need to be paddling the creek!
The description here is one of the creek at optimal
levels: about 1.4 to 1.8 on the take-out bridge. After
a short pool, the first rapid is a good test for the run.
It's a twisting class III-type drop with an undercut wall
on the right at the bottom. If you have trouble here,
it's probably a good idea to just go load your boat on the
car and go hiking! This is followed by some nice surfing
ledges and then another class III drop which pushes hard
into a big rock on the left. More surfing between short
pools can be had for while before the current picks up
and pushes into a long, class III+ drop. This one
is always memorable - for the safest ride stay generally
left, avoid the holes and pours and then paddle really
hard into the final hydraulic! If you've made it this far
and are having fun, you should be in good shape. If not,
the road stays very near the creek for almost the enitre
run, so walking out is always an option. Eventually you'll
pass a small cabin on the left in a big pool. At the end of
the pool, take the right chute, but watch out for trees -
it's very narrow. After this, you'll have a few holes
and a lot of short, tree-choked spots to navigate. After
a few of these, you'll come to where you've hopefully marked
the eddy upstream of the low water bridge. In 2003 the
eddy on river right was marked with yellow paint on a tree,
but make sure this marking is visible before running
down to the bridge! If you don't get stopped in this eddy
you're likely to run past some bushes and find yourself
heading for the bridge with little hope of stopping. If you
go too far, try to fight through the brush on the river
left side just above the bridge and hit the small eddy
there. People have pinned under this bridge and very nearly
drowned - take it VERY seriously! After you portage the
bridge, you'll be in the middle section of the creek.
Lots of fast class II+ action with lots of trees. When you
are comming down a shallow, open drop into a pool with a
nice big sitting rock in front of you, watch out for
a cable that hangs into the river! After this pool you'll
go through some more rapids with loads of trees (as always)
and there are two more cables. Portage these if they're in
the creek and if you can get stopped in time. Several
folks have taken a cable in the chest when they haven't
stopped - be very careful! Pretty soon you'll see Knoppers
Ford Campground on your right - get out above the bridge on
the right and portage it. Now you're on the bottom section
of the run - flatter water in general with one very notable
exception. When you find yourself having to dodge trees
and run over ledgy shoals at the same time (weird) get
ready! When you see a horizon line comming, eddy out
on the right and you can scout the big drop from your
boat. The hole usually isn't too bad (except at flood
levels) but the drop is powerful and rocky. Good luck!
If the water's extremely high, be careful not to paddle
into the bridge at Jack Cr. Rec. Area, about 1/2 mile
downstream from the big ledge. Otherwise you can paddle
under it and take out at the recreation area. If you
paddle Sugar Cr. at low levels, you're going to think
the creek is overrated. If you hit it with enough
water, you're likely to think this description is quite
conservative! I've glossed over many bad willow jungles,
long rapids, and potentially nasty holes. Just make sure
you would feel confident running the Esses on the Cossatot
with a bunch of trees in it, and you'll probably have
fun on Sugar Cr. at optimum to high water. Or wait for the
creek to drop, and you'll find a creek where an experienced
class II boater will have a good time. Because of the dozens
of trees and man-made hazards, it's always best to paddle
Sugar with someone who knows the creek well.

Upper Upper Shoal Cr.
Rating: III+ _
TDCR: 6676
Location: Put in via old logging road (now a horse trail) on east side
near top of Mt. Magazine. Turn right off of the state highway onto
a logging road in the middle of the first big "U" turn coming down
the north side from top of mountain. Turn right at the next
intersection and head for the creek. On a map, the put-in
is about 1/4 mile directly (as the crow flies) east of the
new state park visitor center. Take out is at regular Shoal
Creek put in.
Topo Quad(s): N/A
Gradient: ? fpm
Length: N/A
Season: FLOOD
Gauge: Run only when its almost too high at the normal Shoal Cr.
put-in. A whole lot of rain is needed!
Hazards: Absolutely no eddies till near the bottom of the
run... extremely fast, extremely narrow, hi-banked V shaped
sides of river (nearly a slot in some areas) and very
technical. You'll find yourself purposefully sliding over
rocks to slow yourself down enough to have good control.
Description: Date of first descent was 1979, in open boats, 16 ft blue
hole OCA's, by Fred Baker (Fort Smith), John Williams
(Booneville), Jim Gardner (Van Buren). The whole stretch was
nicknamed "The Shoal Sluice" by the first descent group.
Only runnable once or twice a year at maximum, when other
rivers and creeks are in flood. Thanks go to Fred Baker
for information on Upper Upper Shoal Cr.
