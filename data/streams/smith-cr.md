## Description

Smith Creek carries class III-V water when it's up, and the Highway 21 crossing serves as the visual gauge for half the creeks in Newton County. When Smith Creek's running muddy and high, paddlers know there's water on Adkins Creek and Boen Gulf - it's the bellwether for the whole drainage. That's how these mountains work - you read one creek to know what the others are doing.
