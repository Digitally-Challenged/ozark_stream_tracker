## Description
Fern Gulley. The name sounds gentle, but the water isn't. This is the jewel of steep creeking in the southern Ozarks - four miles of class IV-V water that doesn't let up, doesn't give you time to breathe, doesn't offer much in the way of forgiveness.

Three hundred feet per mile average gradient, with half a mile hitting four hundred. Almost no eddies. Constant class IV intensity with class V interruptions. You start with The Test at class IV, proving you belong here. Then Rooster Poot, also class IV. Then Dumb and Dumber earns its V rating proper.

After that comes Whack-A-Yaker, followed by The Drop Zone - two hundred yards of class V staircase that'll make you understand why this creek carries a 9895 TDCR. That's one of the hardest ratings in the state. Then you finish with Big Juju, which is exactly what it sounds like.

This creek's 2.75 miles on Little Mill Creek, then the rest on Fern Gulley proper. What else there is to know, well, that's between you and whoever's run it before. And there aren't many who have.
