## Description

This is the Franklin County Hurricane Creek - not to be confused with its namesake over in Newton and Pope. Class II+ water, friendly enough for folks still learning how to ferry and catch eddies without making it look like a yard sale.

Good stepping stone between easy water and the steeper stuff. Arkansas has three different Hurricane Creeks, which tells you something about how often storms tear through these hills.
