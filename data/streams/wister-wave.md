## Description

Over near Wister in eastern Oklahoma, there's a wave that sets up when the conditions come together right. Probably tied to dam releases or the river's mood, the kind of feature that brings out the playboaters when word spreads that it's on.

Different game than the downriver runs, but river features don't care what state they're in or what kind of kayaking you prefer. Water makes waves, and waves make smiles.
