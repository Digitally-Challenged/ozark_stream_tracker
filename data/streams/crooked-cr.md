## Description

Advanced creek running in Arkansas hill country, Class III-IV with possible Class V rapids when everything lines up wrong. This is technical water for paddlers who know what they're doing.

The name tells you something – creeks don't run straight in the Ozarks, and this one takes that to heart. Limited public information available, which generally means the locals know it and everyone else should ask questions before showing up.

Contact the paddling community for current access and conditions. Not the place to learn advanced creek technique.
