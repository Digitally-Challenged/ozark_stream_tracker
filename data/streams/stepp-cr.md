## Description

This one keeps its secrets close. What we know is that Stepp Creek runs hard - class IV pushing into IV+ territory when the water's up. The folks who've been down it don't talk much, just nod when you ask if it's worth the trouble. That ought to tell you something.

You'll be hunting for beta on this one. The creekboaters who know where it is and when to run it tend to share that knowledge over campfires, not on the internet.
