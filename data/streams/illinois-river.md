# Illinois River

## Overview
**Rating:** Class I-II
**Watershed Size:** L
**Gradient:** Gentle
**Length:** 145 miles total, ~65.4 miles navigable in Oklahoma
**Season:** Year-round, best spring through fall

## Description
The Illinois starts up in the Boston Mountains near Hogeye, Arkansas, and runs 145 miles west into Oklahoma before it finds Tenkiller Lake. Between those points, it cuts through limestone country - the kind of bluffs that catch afternoon light just right, rolling Ozark hills that haven't changed much in your lifetime or mine.

Class I to II water, mostly. Gentle enough for canoes and rafts, spirited enough to keep you honest. The river sees heavy traffic around Tahlequah - that town built itself on Illinois River dollars - and you'll know it when peak season hits. Crowds change a river's character some. Water quality varies too, section by section, season by season.

But catch it on a weekday in May or September, put in at Watts and take out wherever suits you along those 65 navigable Oklahoma miles, and you'll see why folks keep coming back. The Oklahoma Scenic Rivers Commission maintains good access, which matters when you're planning a float. Arkansas has its own sections up near the headwaters - Twin Bridges to Siloam Springs runs about eight hours when there's water.
