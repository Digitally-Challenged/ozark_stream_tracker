## Description
Frog Bayou runs through Crawford County teaching new paddlers how to read moving water without scaring them off the sport. Class II water - enough to keep you honest, not enough to keep you up at night.

What makes this one useful is how the gauge tells you what's happening elsewhere. When Frog Bayou's up around five feet, you'll know Clear Creek and Cedar Creek are worth the drive. Rivers talk to each other like that if you know how to listen.
