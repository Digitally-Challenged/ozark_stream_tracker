## Description

First descent June 17, 2000. Some creeks get overlooked because they're mean enough that nobody talks about them. Adkins is one of those – 1.75 miles of blind boulder piles that'll test whether you've got the skills or just the gear.

The creek opens with three blind ledges they call "Gimme Three Steps," and if you're smart you'll heed that Skynyrd warning. Then comes "The Last Step" – a big drop into an undercut grotto that earned its name the hard way. Downstream you'll find "Ghost's Hole" and "Dead Man's Leap," neither of which got called that for being friendly.

After Adkins dumps you out, you've still got 13 miles of floodstage Hailstone Creek to navigate. This is wilderness paddling where the only thing continuous is the commitment. You'll need expert-level skills and local knowledge, or you'll be providing both to the next group through.
