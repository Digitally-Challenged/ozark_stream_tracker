## Description

The Middle Fork of the White River cuts through Arkansas hill country, one of three forks that eventually become the main stem. Like a lot of these tributaries, it keeps its character to itself until you're actually on the water.

The lack of details might mean it hasn't been run much, or it might mean the folks who run it haven't gotten around to writing it down. Either way, you're doing some exploring.
