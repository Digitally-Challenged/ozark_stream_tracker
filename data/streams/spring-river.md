# Spring River

## Overview
**Rating:** Class I-II
**Watershed Size:** L
**Gradient:** Gentle to moderate
**Length:** ~100+ miles (Arkansas and Oklahoma sections)
**Season:** Year-round (spring-fed)

## Description
The Spring River rises from underground and runs cold and clear through Arkansas and Oklahoma, its flow steady year-round while other creeks come and go with the rain. That spring-fed consistency makes it reliable water - you can plan a trip in August or February and know the river'll be there waiting. The Arkansas sections run from Mammoth Springs down through Hardy and Ravenden to Old Davidsonville, with the South Fork adding its own cold water to the mix. Across the state line, the Oklahoma stretch carries the same clear character. Class I to II water throughout, gravel bars for camping, bluffs in places where the rock shows through. It's popular for good reason - consistent flows, clear water, and enough miles to choose your own distance.
