# Spring River

## Overview

**Rating:** Class I-II
**Watershed Size:** L
**Gradient:** Gentle to moderate
**Length:** ~60 miles (Arkansas)
**Season:** Year-round (spring-fed)

## Description

The Spring River rises from Mammoth Spring in north-central Arkansas and runs cold and clear through the Ozarks, its flow steady year-round while other creeks come and go with the rain. That spring-fed consistency makes it reliable water - you can plan a trip in August or February and know the river'll be there waiting. The main sections run from Mammoth Spring down through Hardy and Ravenden to the confluence with the Black River near Black Rock, with the South Fork adding its own cold water to the mix near Hardy. Class I to II water throughout, gravel bars for camping, bluffs in places where the rock shows through. It's popular for good reason - consistent flows, clear water, and enough miles to choose your own distance.
