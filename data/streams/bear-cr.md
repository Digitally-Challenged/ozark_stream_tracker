## Description

First descent December 12, 1999. Bear Creek drains into Middle Big Piney, and like its namesake it'll maul you if you don't respect what you're walking into. Opens with a 50-60 yard stair-stepping slide that funnels down steep, then cuts into a gorge so narrow you can almost touch both sides.

That first mile and a quarter drops 300 feet per mile. Technical doesn't half describe it – you're threading tight lines through boulder fields and long slides with no room for second-guessing. "Baby Bear Falls" drops 15-plus feet into a grotto. "Mama Bear Falls" is a 20-yard slide into a notch four feet wide, which is about as welcoming as it sounds. Then "Papa Bear Falls" finishes the family reunion with multiple 12-foot drops.

Below the bears, the creek eases to fast class II before joining Big Piney. But don't relax too much – this creek stays tight enough to pin a boat in places where you won't want to be pinned.
