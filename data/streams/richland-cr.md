**Watershed Size:** M

**Length:** Section 1: 6 mi, Section 2: 10 mi
**Season:** Rainfall dependent

## Description

Richland Creek rises north of Highway 16 on Raspberry Mountain, then delivers one of the premier advanced whitewater runs in Arkansas. Don't let the Wild and Scenic designation fool you - Section 1 is serious class III-IV water with a 55 fpm gradient that approaches 80 fpm in places, featuring named rapids that demand respect.

The upper section (S1, 6 miles) is technical, challenging whitewater. Richland Falls announces itself with a 6-foot drop. Then comes Crack in the Rock (III+) and Knuckle Buster (III+), followed by Upper Screw Up (III). The most dangerous rapid is Lower Screw Up, also called Shaw's Folly (IV), which features a badly undercut rock. Maytag (III) rounds out the named rapids. At higher levels, the water volume and steep gradient can create a very dangerous combination, making for a solid class IV-V run.

Section 2 (10 miles) runs class II-III with a gentler 20 fpm gradient. The lower section and the creek mouth at Woolum offer the scenic wilderness experience - gravel bars that catch the light just right, the ability to paddle upstream to Richland Falls if the water's right, and miles of country that hasn't changed much in a hundred years.

## Hazards

Section 1 (Class III-IV):

- Lower Screw Up/Shaw's Folly (IV): Most dangerous rapid with badly undercut rock
- Richland Falls: 6-foot drop requiring precise line
- Crack in the Rock (III+) and Knuckle Buster (III+): Technical rapids demanding attention
- At high water: Volume and steep gradient (approaching 80 fpm in sections) can push run to class IV-V
- Wilderness setting means long distance from help
- Water comes and goes with the rain

Section 2 (Class II-III):

- Access points are scarce as hen's teeth
- Wilderness means wilderness - you're a long way from the truck
- Technical stretches that'll keep you honest
