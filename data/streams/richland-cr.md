## Description
Richland Creek rises north of Highway 16 on Raspberry Mountain, then spills down through one of the prettiest wilderness stretches in the Buffalo country. The creek earned its Wild and Scenic designation honest - you'll find gravel bars that catch the light just right, waterfalls that echo through the hollows, and miles of country that hasn't changed much in a hundred years. The put-in at Woolum sits across from the creek mouth on a gravel bar that might be the finest piece of river real estate on the entire Buffalo. You can paddle upstream from there to Richland Falls if the water's right. Some paddlers spend a full day just exploring the wilderness area north of Falling Water Falls, counting waterfalls like other folks count miles.
