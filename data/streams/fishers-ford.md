## Description
Fisher's Ford is where you bring folks who've never been in a boat before, or kids who need to learn that rivers can be gentle too. Easy water on the Illinois, the kind that forgives sloppy paddle strokes and lets you look around at the country instead of worrying about what's downstream.

Good place to start. Everyone's got to start somewhere.
