## Description
You'll find Fall Creek wearing the same numbers as the Cossatot, but don't let that fool you. The water runs different here, the rocks read different, the whole thing asks different questions of a paddler. Same rating on paper, different river in practice.

This one sees its share of boats come through, and there's a reason for that. What those reasons are, you'll have to ask someone who knows the place better than the record books do.
