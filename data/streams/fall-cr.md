## Description
You'll find Fall Creek wearing the same numbers as the Cossatot, but don't let that fool you. The water runs different here, the rocks read different, the whole thing asks different questions of a paddler. Same rating on paper, different river in practice.

Twelve miles total, but it's those first four that'll test you proper. The gradient hits eighty feet per mile in the first stretch, then settles to fifty for the remainder. "Threes with trees" is how folks describe it - at high water you'll find few eddies and no pools, just continuous class III water threading through obstacles.

The named rapids tell their own story. Introduction gets you started at class III. Poke in the Eye earns its name. Then you've got Hal's Falls, also class III, but at higher levels that terminal hydraulic becomes something you need to think about carefully.

End of the sixth mile brings the worst hazard on the creek: two barbed wire fences stretched across the water. Extremely dangerous, difficult to spot, and exactly where you don't want them. Keep your eyes sharp.

- Whatever you learned on the Cossatot won't prepare you for this one. Different animal entirely.
