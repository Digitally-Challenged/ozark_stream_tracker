## Description
When regular Shoal Creek isn't quite enough, there's the Upper section. When Upper Shoal isn't quite enough, there's this - the headwaters run, where the creek's still gathering its strength but already knows how to use it. Class III+ through tight quarters.

It's like climbing higher up the holler to find where the spring starts. More effort to get there, but you're seeing the creek before it smooths out and settles down.
