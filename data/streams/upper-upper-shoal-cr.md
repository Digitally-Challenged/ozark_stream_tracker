## Description

When regular Shoal Creek isn't quite enough, there's the Upper section. When Upper Shoal isn't quite enough, there's this - the headwaters run nicknamed "The Shoal Sluice" by the group that made the first descent in 1979 in open boats. This tells you everything you need to know.

Absolutely no eddies till near the bottom of the run. Extremely fast, extremely narrow, with high-banked V-shaped sides that turn the creek into nearly a slot in some areas. It's very technical, and you'll find yourself purposefully sliding over rocks to slow yourself down enough to have good control. Only runnable once or twice a year at maximum levels.

It's like climbing higher up the holler to find where the spring starts, except the spring is shooting you downhill like water through a pipe. More effort to get there, and when you arrive, there's no stopping till you reach the bottom.
