## Description

Down in Tulsa where the Arkansas River rolls through, there's a wave that forms up when conditions align. Urban kayaking at its finest - you can surf a standing wave while the city hums along on both banks.

Different kind of paddling than the Ozark creeks, but the river doesn't care about state lines or what kind of boat you brought.
