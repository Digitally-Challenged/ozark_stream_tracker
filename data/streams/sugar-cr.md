## Description

Sugar Creek runs class III through Pope County, but its real claim to fame is the service it provides to Bear Creek paddlers. When you cross the Highway 123 bridge and see Sugar flowing good, you know Bear Creek upstream is coming in.

It's what the old-timers call a tell - nature's gauge, written in current and color. Been working that way longer than the USGS has been measuring anything.
