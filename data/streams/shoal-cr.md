## Description

Shoal Creek runs solid class III water, and somewhere upstream there's an Upper Upper Shoal Creek that bumps up to III+ - whether that's a different fork or just what folks call the headwaters depends on who's talking. Either way, it's legitimate intermediate water that'll test your creek skills without getting into expert territory.
