# East Fork White R.

**TDCR:** 1332
**Gradient:** Less than 20 fpm
**Length:** 1.75 miles
**Season:** FALL, SPRING
**Topo Quads:** Madison County

## Description

Most paddlers don't know this one's here, which is fine by the Fayetteville locals who use it for afternoon floats when the bigger creeks are blown out or dried up.

Short shuttle, easy access, and a watershed big enough to hold water up to a week after decent rain. That's the real gift – while the small creeks in Madison County flash and fade, the East Fork White keeps running. Makes it a good training ground, the kind of place you can count on to work on your strokes without driving to the Buffalo.

Less than 20 feet per mile gradient, so it's not going to scare you. Just Class II with a star for the occasional surprise. One and three-quarter miles from put-in to take-out near Durham.
