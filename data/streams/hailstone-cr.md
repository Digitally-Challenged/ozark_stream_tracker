## Description
Hailstone Creek might be the ultimate Arkansas wilderness run - fourteen miles of class II to III+ water through country that doesn't see many boats. This isn't a victory lap. This is a full-day expedition that'll take six hours or more to complete, a proper wilderness paddle where you're committed once you put in.

The creek reads steady enough through most of its length, forty feet per mile gradient keeping you honest but not overwhelming. Then about halfway down you'll find what makes this run memorable: an undercut cave on the left bank where a significant portion of the river just disappears. Water gets pulled into that darkness like it's got business down there. At high water, that cave could be a killer.

There's been close calls. Boaters swept toward that hole, stuck on debris, fighting to get clear. The kind of thing that reminds you why wilderness runs require respect. This isn't Adkins Creek or Boen Gulf where you can walk out if things go wrong. Out here, you're in it till you're done.

Most everybody pulls out at the Highway 21 bridge, right where Hailstone meets the Buffalo. Fourteen miles, six hours, one serious hazard to avoid. That's Hailstone Creek.
