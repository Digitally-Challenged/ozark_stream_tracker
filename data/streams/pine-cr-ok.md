## Description

This Pine Creek runs in Oklahoma, not to be confused with any of the Arkansas cousins carrying the same name. The details are scarce, which means you'll want to talk to folks who've run it before you load your boat. Sometimes the best information comes from the parking lot, not the guidebook.
