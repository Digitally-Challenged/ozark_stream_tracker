# Boulder Cr.

## Overview

**Rating:** IV-V+ (P)
**TDCR:** 9996
**Gradient:** 250 fpm average (1.25 mile section over 500 fpm)
**Length:** 2.75 miles
**Season:** FLOOD
**Topo Quads:** Newton County

## Description

First attempt November 7, 1996 by Bill and Chanoy Herring and Kevin Fendley. They made it three-quarters of a mile before injury ended that conversation. First successful run came April 23, 2004 during the "Earth Day Floods" when Zach Williams, Sean Ruggles, and Bill Herring completed it in 7-plus hours with a dozen portages.

The vital statistics are sobering: 250 feet per mile average gradient, with a quarter-mile section dropping 200 feet. Huge boulders create nearly continuous and blind class IV-V rapids mixed with sieves. This is the kind of creek where the rock decides and you adapt.

You'll find Upper Gorge with its boulder jumble under the bluff. "Strainer Strainer," which is a rock sieve. "Pretzel," a class IV+ that twists you around. "Elbow," a very long class V with tricky ledges. "The Falls" – a quarter-mile section that lives up to the name. "Pearly Gate," a steep plunge between boulders. "Salvation Eddy," where you'll understand why it's called that. "Cliff Rapid" with its large sieve. "Just When You Thought It Was Over," which answers that thought.

Suitable only for a team of well-prepared class V creek boaters. Expect multiple portages and a full day commitment. This creek doesn't care if you're ready or not, but you'd better be.
