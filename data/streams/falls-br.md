## Description
Falls Branch runs class III to V, which is to say it runs hard when it runs at all. First descent came April 22, 1996, and after that first run they started calling it "Dead Falls Branch" on account of all the downed trees. That ought to tell you something about what you're getting into.

Nine miles total, four of them on Falls Branch proper, and that first mile will get your attention quick - three hundred feet per mile or better, water coming downhill like it's got somewhere to be. The gradient settles to one-fifty for the remainder, which sounds reasonable until you're in it.

You've got Nate's Falls early on - ten to twelve foot drop with undercut boulders that require respect. Then there's Surprise Turn, which earned its name the hard way. The kind of water where things can go sideways in a hurry and you better have the skills to deal with it.

Not many folks run this one. Probably for good reason.
