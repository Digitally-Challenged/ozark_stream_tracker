## Description

Hart Creek feeds into Blackburn with class III-IV water and possibly worse, depending on what the rain's been doing. Technical tributary that demands respect and skills to match.

Now here's something worth knowing: when Lee Creek pushes over ten or twelve feet, there's a hydraulic forms just past where Hart meets Blackburn. Local paddlers call it the hole-o-death, and they're not being dramatic. That's the kind of feature you scout from shore, then decide whether your boat sees it or not.
