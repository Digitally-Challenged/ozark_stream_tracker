# Big Devils Fork Cr.

## Overview
**Rating:** III-V*
**TDCR:** 8786
**Gradient:** 190 fpm (not counting Richland)
**Length:** 2.4 miles plus 1.5 miles on Richland
**Season:** FLOOD
**Topo Quads:** Newton County

## Description
First descent April 11, 1995. Big Devils Fork starts tiny but builds intensity fast, like a fire catching hold. You'll hit many tough class III to IV rapids mixed with strainers and undercut rocks before you even get to the main event.

That main event is Twin Falls near where the creek meets Richland. Depending on water levels, you can run Big Devils Fork on the left or carry over to Long Devils Fork. In 20-plus runs, only two or three people have found clean lines on Long Devil's Falls, which ought to tell you something about the odds.

This is experts only. The course runs extremely tight, the gradient's high, and there's significant risk to life and limb. Not the kind of thing you say to sound dramatic – just the way it is.
