# Little Piney Creek

## Description
The Little Piney runs that same creme de menthe green as its big brother, winding through the Boston Mountains with a mind of its own. You'll find yourself dodging willow thickets that are hungry for canoes and picking lines through rocky shoals and boulder gardens. It flows close to the headwaters of the Big Piney and the Kings, good company for a creek to keep. When the water's right, it's a fine run through the heart of the Ozark National Forest.
