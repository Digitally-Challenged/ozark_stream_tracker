## Description
Near Richland Creek, Long Devils Fork meets up with Big Devils Fork to form Twin Falls, and you'll want to pay attention here. Long Devils Fork features one of the longest rock slides in Arkansas - expect to reach terminal velocity if there's sufficient water.

The centerpiece is a 16 to 18 foot waterfall at Twin Falls. Run it left of center and try to maintain good speed to launch well into the pool below. Several pitons have occurred due to low-speed runs - this is not a place to hesitate.

Out of twenty-plus runs, folks have found only two or three clean lines down Long Devil's Falls. That tells you something about the kind of water you're dealing with. Depending on what the creek's giving you, you can run Big Devils Fork on the left or take a short carry to the Long Devils Fork side. Either way, you'll earn your supper. This is the kind of run where you scout more than you paddle, and there's no shame in that.
