## Description

The Illinois River wears different faces depending on where you catch it. Up at Hogeye Run, you'll find Class II+ water that pushes back just enough to keep things interesting - good water for learning what your boat can do. Down at Fisher's Ford, it's mellowed out to Class I, the kind of float where you can bring a cooler and not worry about it ending up in a tree.

Multiple outfitters work this river, which tells you something about its temperament. Popular doesn't always mean good, but the Illinois has earned its traffic. The water's forgiving enough for first-timers, spirited enough for locals who've run it a hundred times.
