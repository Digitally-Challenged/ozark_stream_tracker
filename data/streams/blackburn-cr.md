## Description

Great class II+ wilderness run that got overlooked for years, probably because the folks who knew about it were too busy paddling it. First run likely happened mid-1980s, but nobody bothered to write it down.

What you get is a bouncy run through several miles of wild country near Devils Den State Park – fast curves and swift rapids with strainers keeping you awake. At normal levels, no serious hazards for competent class II-III boaters. Just good wilderness paddling through scenic country.

But when Lee Creek pushes over 10-12 feet, a hole forms just past Hart Creek confluence. They call it "hole-o-death," and unlike most rapid names, that one's not overselling. When Lee hits 15 feet, the strainers turn the whole creek into a death trap. There's a reason the locals know not to run it high.

## Access Points

### Put-in

**Location:** Near Devils Den State Park, I-540 area

### Take-out

**Location:** Lee Creek at Highway 220 bridge (Section 2 put-in)
**Directions:** Highway 220 bridge over Lee Creek. Shuttle back through Chester (Fall Creek blocks Devils Den route at high water).
