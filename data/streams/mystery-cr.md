## Description
They call it Mystery Creek, and maybe that's because not many folks talk about running it. Class IV+ to V water doesn't invite casual conversation. This is the kind of creek where you'd better know your limits and respect when you're looking at water that exceeds them. Some runs earn their mystery by keeping most paddlers guessing from shore.
