## Description

They call it Mystery Creek now, but it started as an inside joke - the first descent crew wouldn't tell even close friends the name until the day of the run. November 14, 1993, eight kayakers put in at elevation 1840 and didn't take out until well after dark, hiking roads by flashlight to find their vehicles. These days folks call it Sandy Springs Hollow, after the small hollow at the put-in.

The gradient tells the story: 190 feet per mile average, with half a mile hitting 320. This is the extreme upper section of the East Fork Little Buffalo, and it rates right up there with the hardest hair runs in the Ozarks. Water levels fall fast on a watershed this tiny - put in early.

The creek starts with fast slides, then a class III ledge before boulders choke it into something much more serious. At lower water, pins are likely for the next half mile. At higher water, a downed tree becomes life-threatening at this gradient.

The highlight is Rooster's Two Step - named for the 3-foot step above a 12-foot waterfall, first run by David Bibbs (they called him "The Rooster"). The approach is a blind curve left with one potential eddy on the right. If you boat around that corner, hang on tight.

After the Rooster, the gradient stays serious and the rocks get big and ugly. Bad sieves at low water mean mandatory portages. Higher water opens things up, but good luck slowing down - a flip here means a serious beating. When the main EFLB stem comes in from the right, you're not done - that creek will be big and brawny at these levels, possibly the wildest part of your day.

If there's any doubt, put in on the EFLB instead.

## Access Points

### Put-in

**Location:** South of Deer on Hwy 16
**Directions:** Turn right just past Deer Church on outskirts of town. After about 2 miles, turn right again on smaller dirt road descending a hill. Go straight to hit creek directly, or turn left and follow road that parallels creek until it ends.

### Take-out

**Location:** EFLB take-out
**Directions:** See EFLB description for take-out directions.

## Hazards

- **Rooster's Two Step** - 3-foot step into 12-foot waterfall with blind approach
- **Extreme gradient** - 190 fpm average, 320 fpm in steepest section
- **Boulder sieves** - Mandatory portages at lower water levels
- **Strainers** - Life-threatening at this gradient
- **Water level drops fast** - Tiny watershed means early put-in required
- **First descent ended after dark** - This run takes longer than you think
- As difficult a steep creek as the Ozarks has to offer
