# Kings River

## Overview

**Watershed Size:** L
**Gradient:** Variable (steep in upper, gentle in lower)
**Length:** 93.5 miles total
**Season:** Rainfall dependent

## Description

The Kings River runs 93 miles wearing two completely different personalities. First eleven miles from Dripping Springs to Highway 74, it's Class III+ whitewater that doesn't suffer fools - steep, pushy, technical water with a waterfall at the Natural Area that you'll want to scout. This is the Upper Kings, for paddlers who've earned their stripes elsewhere.

Then at Highway 74, something shifts. The river settles into Class I to I+ for the next 82 miles up into Missouri, through Mark Twain National Forest to Table Rock Lake. This is where families put in at Rockhouse for the eight-mile float to Trigger Gap - gravel bars, swimming holes, interesting rock formations, the kind of day that doesn't require a roll.

The state calls it an "Extraordinary Resource Waterbody," which is bureaucracy's way of saying they know what they've got. No dams on the Arkansas stretch. Rural land, forested banks. The Kings rises in the Boston Mountains right near where Big Piney, the Hailstone, Mulberry, and Little Piney all start their runs - good company for a creek to keep.

Water quality matters here enough that they wrote restrictions on what you can do to the streambed, what you can build in the basin. The Arkansas Nature Conservancy owns land along the Rockhouse run, which tells you something about the value people place on keeping this one wild.
