## Description

First run January 1994 by Cowper Chadbourn, Jim McDaniel, and Paul Newton. Just 2.5 miles long, but it packs in about ten very significant rapids plus lots of class III action between them.

Opens with three-quarters of a mile of shallow, fast class II-III through willows and downed trees, warming you up for what's coming. Then you hit "Zorro" – a tight slot with a wave and hole train. "Go Left Falls" (also called "Cowper Dam" after the guy who scouted it) sends water off slanted rock into a narrow slot with an undercut. "Coliseum" makes you go right down a 6-foot stairstep.

After some class II-III, you reach the feature section: "Bail-Baby-Bail," "Werewolf," "The Funnel," "The Slot." That final three-quarters of a mile is Ozark steep creekin' at its best – the kind of paddling that reminds you why you do this.

Considered one of the best runs in the area. You'll need skills on par with Beech or Shop Creek, just condensed into a shorter package. After Bobtail dumps you into Richland, you've got 9.5 miles to think about what just happened.
