# Archey Cr.

## Overview

**Rating:** II+
**TDCR:** ????
**Gradient:** Unknown
**Length:** 20 miles
**Season:** RAIN
**Topo Quads:** Pope and Van Buren County

## Description

They call it Archey's Fork of Little Red, and it's one of those rare Ozark runs where you can stretch your legs over two days if you've got camping permissions sorted out. Twenty miles is a long haul by creek standards, but Archey keeps you honest with class II+ rapids running pretty much continuous the whole way.

The willows here don't quit. They lean over the water like they're trying to catch something, and what they catch is boats that don't pay attention. But if you're looking for an overnight trip with sustained whitewater action and you're tired of the usual runs, Archey'll treat you right.
