## Description
Little Sugar Creek's one of those Arkansas runs that stays mostly off the written record. Could be it's too small to bother with except in good rain. Could be the people who paddle it prefer keeping quiet.

Either way, you'll want to talk to locals before you make the drive. Some creeks only exist in memory and after thunderstorms.
