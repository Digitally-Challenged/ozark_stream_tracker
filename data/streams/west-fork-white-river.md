## Description

The West Fork of the White River runs gentle through most of its length - class I-II water that'll teach you to read current without punishing your mistakes too hard. Here and there a class III rapid shows up to keep you honest, but mostly this is water where you can learn the rhythm of moving water.

Good place to figure out whether you like this kind of thing before the creeks start demanding more from you.
