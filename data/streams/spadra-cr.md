## Description

Spadra Creek runs right through Clarksville, delivering class III+ water that sits right at the top of the intermediate game. That plus sign isn't for decoration - it means you'll find moves here that demand clean lines and solid boat control. It's technical enough to keep you honest without crossing the line into full-blown expert territory. You'd do well to respect it.
