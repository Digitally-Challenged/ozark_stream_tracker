## Description
Little Mill Creek runs Class III to IV, and so do its tributaries - West Fork and Middle Fork both come in technical and steep. This is a creek system for paddlers who've put in their years, who know the difference between confident and cocky.

Three forks of advanced whitewater braiding through the same drainage. The Ozarks have a way of hiding water like this in the folds of the hills, waiting for someone skilled enough to find it.
