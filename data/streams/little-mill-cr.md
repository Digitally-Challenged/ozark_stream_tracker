## Description
Little Mill runs class III to IV over nearly three miles, dropping a hundred and twenty feet to the mile. The first mile's steeper, hitting one-eighty, and you'll feel every bit of it. You've got named drops like Gollum's Hole and Stone Ground to keep you busy, but The Gash is where you'll earn your keep - a class IV pinball game around a mid-stream rock into a sluice that demands you handle your boat. Love Shack Falls marks the biggest drop at six or seven feet. It's a system for folks who know the difference between confident and cocky.

The tributaries - West Fork and Middle Fork - both come in technical and steep. This is a creek system for paddlers who've put in their years. The Ozarks have a way of hiding water like this in the folds of the hills, waiting for someone skilled enough to find it.
