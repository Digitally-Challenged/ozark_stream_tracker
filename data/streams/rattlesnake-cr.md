## Description
Rattlesnake Hollow - officially named Rattlesnake Hollow, not Rattlesnake Creek - is a short but intense 0.6-mile park-and-hike run with a gradient of 400 feet per mile. First run in June 2000 by Bill Herring and Trey Marley, this is expert water that can be scouted, run, and shuttled in less than 1.5 hours.

The highlight and main hazard is a 25-foot sheer plunge into a small 6-foot deep pool. About 100 feet of fast water leads to this massive drop, and after the fall, a rapid starts and doesn't stop for about half a mile. This is class IV-V water where you scout from shore and commit from your boat, and there's no turning back once you've made the choice.
