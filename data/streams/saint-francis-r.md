# Saint Francis River (Missouri)

## Overview
**Rating:** Class II-IV
**Watershed Size:** L
**Gradient:** Moderate to steep in whitewater sections
**Length:** Multiple sections available
**Season:** Winter-Spring; after heavy rain in summer/fall

## Description
The Saint Francis River is Missouri's only true whitewater river, drawing paddlers from St. Louis and beyond when spring rains bring the water up. The Millstream Gardens to Silver Mines section is the classic run - exposed granite and igneous rock create legitimate Class II-III rapids (up to IV-V in flood stage) unlike anything else in the state. The river is fed entirely by runoff, so timing matters - check gauges and be ready to go when the window opens. The Missouri Whitewater Association calls this home, and their annual Missouri Whitewater Championships in March has been running for nearly 60 years.
