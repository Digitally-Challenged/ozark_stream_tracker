# Saint Francis River (Missouri)

## Overview

**Rating:** Class II-IV
**Watershed Size:** L
**Gradient:** Moderate to steep in whitewater sections
**Length:** Multiple sections available
**Season:** Winter-Spring; after heavy rain in summer/fall

## Description

The Saint Francis stands alone as Missouri's only true whitewater river. When the spring rains come, paddlers from St. Louis and all over head for the granite shut-ins between Millstream Gardens and Silver Mines. You'll find legitimate class II and III rapids here - exposed bedrock and igneous rock that creates lines you won't see anywhere else in the state. In flood stage, those ratings climb to IV and V, so pay attention. It's entirely rain-fed, so you check the gauges and go when the river says go. The Missouri Whitewater Association calls this home, and they've been running championships here for nearly sixty years.
