## Description

Jack Creek runs Class II to III, the sweet spot where you're past paddling in circles but not yet betting your life on your roll. This is learning water - rocks that make you think, current that makes you work, nothing that'll write your obituary if you swim.

Good creek for finding out what you're made of without finding out the hard way.
