## Description
Little Mulberry Creek runs Class III to IV, advanced water that expects you to show up with skills already earned. Not much gets written about creeks like this - they're there if you know where to look, gone if you don't have the water.

The silence around Little Mulberry isn't accidental. Some runs stay quiet because the people who paddle them like it that way.
