# Falling Water Creek

## Overview
**Rating:** Class III-IV
**Watershed Size:** S
**Gradient:** Steep
**Length:** ~11 miles
**Season:** Rainfall dependent (expert level creek)

## Description
Falling Water comes off the north slope of Raspberry Mountain near Highway 16, running eleven miles through country that'll make you understand why folks built a wilderness area next door. Technical water, steep country, the kind of run where you better know what you're doing before you put in.

The creek drops over its namesake falls a few miles east of Ben Hur - big pool below, nice swimming hole when the weather's warm and you're not trying to paddle through it. This is Ozark whitewater done proper: forested canyon walls, waterfalls catching light, water reading like a book you better know how to translate.
