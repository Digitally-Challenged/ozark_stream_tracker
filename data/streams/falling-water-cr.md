# Falling Water Creek

## Overview
**Rating:** Class III
**Watershed Size:** S
**Gradient:** 60+ fpm
**Length:** 6 miles
**Season:** Rainfall dependent (expert level creek)

## Description
Falling Water comes off the north slope of Raspberry Mountain near Highway 16, running six miles through country that'll make you understand why folks built a wilderness area next door. Class III water in a narrow streambed that drops better than sixty feet per mile. Technical, steep, the kind of run where you better know what you're doing before you put in.

The creek drops over its namesake falls a few miles east of Ben Hur - ten-foot sheer drop, big pool below, nice swimming hole when the weather's warm and you're not trying to paddle through it. At high water those rapids come fast in that narrow channel, few eddies to speak of, just continuous class III reading like a book you better know how to translate.

This is Ozark whitewater done proper: forested canyon walls, waterfalls catching light, water that doesn't give you much time to think between moves.
