# Cadron Creek

## Overview

**Rating:** Class I-III
**Watershed Size:** M
**Gradient:** Variable
**Length:** 59 miles total, ~38.5 miles paddleable (SH 124 to Arkansas River)
**Season:** Rainfall dependent

## Description

You've probably driven over this one a dozen times on Highway 65, heading up to the Buffalo, never giving it a second thought. That's Cadron Creek below you – 59 miles of water running west from the hills near Heber Springs all the way to the Arkansas River, and about 38 of those miles will float a boat when the rain's been decent.

It's the kind of creek that keeps surprising you. Fields and farm houses one bend, then limestone bluffs rising up the next. Canyons cutting through typical Arkansas hill country, the water running Class I-III depending on where you catch it. Not many folks know about it, which suits the locals just fine.

Put in at Highway 124, take out where it meets the Arkansas River a few miles northwest of Little Rock. It's there when you need something closer to home, something that doesn't require driving to the high country.
