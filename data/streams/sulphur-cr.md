## Description

Sulphur Creek sits near the top of the Arkansas difficulty ladder, running class V and not apologizing for it. This is the kind of water where you measure your crew not by how many boats show up, but by how many you'd trust your life with.

The information stays scarce because the people who run it stay careful. If you have to ask where it is, you probably shouldn't be there yet.
