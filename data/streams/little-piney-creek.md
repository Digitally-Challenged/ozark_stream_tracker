# Little Piney Creek

## Overview
**Rating:** Class II-III
**Watershed Size:** M
**Gradient:** Variable
**Length:** ~30 miles (estimated)
**Season:** Rainfall dependent

## Description
Little Piney runs that particular shade of green they call creme de menthe - the color of northern Arkansas creeks when the light's right and the limestone's doing its work. The water threads through willow tangles thick enough to catch a canoe and keep it, over rocky shoals where you pick your line or pay for choosing wrong, through boulder gardens that separate confident paddlers from lucky ones.

Class II to III, depending on the section and the rain. The creek rises in the Boston Mountains right alongside Big Piney, the Hailstone, Kings River, Mulberry, and the Upper White - good company for a creek to start with. All that water heading different directions from the same high country, each one carving its own character into the stone.

Those willows earn their reputation. Traditional canoe-catchers, the old-timers call them, which is gentle language for what happens when you lose your angle in a willow jungle at speed. The creek's pretty enough to make you forget to pay attention, technical enough to punish you for it.
