## Description
Trigger Gap is one of those names that shows up on the old creek lists without much else attached to it. Could be a rapid, could be a whole section, could be what the locals called a put-in thirty years ago.

Sometimes the mystery is part of the appeal. Sometimes it just means you need to buy somebody a beer and ask questions.
