# Cedar Cr.

## Overview

**Rating:** II+
**TDCR:** 4444
**Gradient:** 50 fpm
**Length:** 7 miles
**Season:** RAIN
**Topo Quads:** Crawford County

## Description

Small, swift water running through Crawford County with a choice in your hand – take the West Fork or the East Fork, each with its own temperament.

West Fork below the Highway 162 bridge serves up what some call the best surfing in the state. Continuous waves and holes, the kind of playground water that keeps you busy. That first major hole below the bridge will hold your boat at high levels, so scout it before you commit.

East Fork runs smaller and steeper, more technical drops in the Class II-III range. There's an 8-foot dam you'll need to walk around – no discussion about that one.

When Lee Creek's too low or too high, Cedar often splits the difference. Seven miles of it, running when you need it to.
