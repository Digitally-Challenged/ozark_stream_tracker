## Description

First descent December 17, 1995. Boss Hollow comes at you fast and narrow right from the start – small slides and ledges that build into something bigger. You'll hit a tight technical section with "Toilet Bowl," "Baby Boss Slide," "Face Slap Falls," and "Sycamore Slot." The names aren't trying to be cute.

Then you reach "THE BOSS," which announces itself with "Performance Evaluation," "Broken Paddle," and "Half A Paddle" – three rapids that are really just the entrance exam. The line goes main channel left through a slot, over a ledge, down a narrow slide, then cuts 90 degrees right to a big slide. Thread it clean or don't thread it at all.

Somewhere in here there's a house-sized slab rock that's at least 50% undercut. They call it "The Undercut" because sometimes the obvious name is the right one. Avoid it.

Final two miles down Buck Branch give you many class III drops and several play spots to catch your breath. This is expert-level flood paddling that needs precise boat control and decision-making skills that don't falter under pressure.
