# Mulberry River

## Overview
**Rating:** Class I-II (Class II+ to III at higher flows)
**Watershed Size:** L
**Gradient:** 11-16 feet per mile (varies by section)
**Length:** 56 miles total, ~40 miles good floating
**Season:** Late fall to June (rainfall dependent)

## Description
Fifty-six miles down from the Boston Mountains, the Mulberry finds the Arkansas River, running parallel to Big Piney for much of the way. It's narrow water, continuous, the kind that keeps you working one rapid into the next without much time to think about it. Popular doesn't begin to cover it - you'll likely have company on a good flow weekend.

The action picks up real after Little Mulberry joins in, two miles below Wolf Pen. That's where the creek gets its teeth. At lower flows you'll see mostly class II, but push it to four feet and those rapids start touching class III. Big Al's Twist, Chainsaw Jungle, Jump Start, Whoop and Holler - the names tell you what you're in for. The river twists around curves fast and tight, and you'll need to read ahead because it doesn't slow down to let you think.

Past 2.4 feet, you'd better know what you're doing. At 4.5 and beyond, you'd better know when to stay home.
