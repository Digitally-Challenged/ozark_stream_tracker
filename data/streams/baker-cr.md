## Description
Baker Creek's one of those runs that got a rating but not much else written down. The folks who know it keep paddling it, but they're not the type to fill out beta sheets. What we know is it's solid intermediate water – class III-IV depending on what the rain brings – and it's out there waiting if you're willing to ask around and find your own way in.
