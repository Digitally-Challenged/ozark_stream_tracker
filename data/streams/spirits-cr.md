## Description

Spirits Creek runs four miles of continuous class II-III in a streambed barely 10 to 15 feet wide. Seventy-five feet per mile gradient, with the first mile hitting a hundred. The kind of creek where the rapids don't stop and neither do you.

The run starts with First Ledge - a five-foot class III drop you can scout from a trail on river right. Avoid the eddy on the left below this one. The current flows under a potentially hazardous undercut boulder there, and that's not a lesson you want to learn the hard way.

Three miles of non-stop rapids follow, with strainers common enough that a portage or two should be expected. The streambed stays narrow the whole way - not much room for error, not much room for anything except forward.

Then comes The Funnel at the end of the third mile - a 12-foot class III+ drop that's earned its reputation as one of the best drops in the state. It sits just after a two-foot sloping ledge with a river-wide hydraulic. When you see that horizon line, you'll know you've arrived.

Spirits Creek is highly recommended to those with the skills for non-stop rapids. If you can handle tight, continuous class III and read water fast enough to dodge strainers, this one will reward you. If you can't, Hurricane Creek or Salt Fork are a few minutes' drive away.
