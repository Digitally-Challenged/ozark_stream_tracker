# Ellis Creek

## Overview

**Rating:** Class III-IV
**Watershed Size:** XS
**Gradient:** Steep
**Length:** Short steep run
**Season:** Rain-dependent

## Description

You'll find Ellis Creek feeding the Baron Fork, a steep run that needs a good rain to show its teeth. It's class III to IV water, rising and falling with the storm. Like most creeks this size, timing is everything - you catch it right, and you've got technical lines and tight moves. You catch it wrong, and you're hiking. Watch for wood; these small drainages love to collect timber.
