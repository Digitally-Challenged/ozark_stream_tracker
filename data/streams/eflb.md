## Description
Classic Ozark creek running through Newton County, the kind of water that separates folks who paddle from folks who just say they do. Eight miles starting small and steep at Barberry Creek, picking up volume from three tributaries in the first mile.

You'll hit Half Moon early – Class III that's honest about it. Then comes Johnson's Squeeze, and that's where things get serious. Class V, severely choked down, one of the most dangerous drops in the Ozarks. Portage left and don't argue with it. Below the Squeeze you'll find numerous Class III and III+ rapids cutting through what some claim is the best scenery in the Ozarks.

Second Gorge brings the Obliterator – mean hole with a twisting approach that makes the entrance as hard as the drop. At high water, it's basically one long Class IV+ rapid with blind drops coming at you continuous.

Third Gorge has a different personality altogether, saving its hardest drops for the end. There's a Class III+ with a bruising landing zone, though you can sneak left if you're paying attention.

Take out at the low water bridge a mile past Third Gorge, or push on to Murray if you're not done yet. Either way, you'll have earned your supper.
