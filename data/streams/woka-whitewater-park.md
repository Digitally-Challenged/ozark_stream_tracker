## Description
WOKA - Waters of Oklahoma and Arkansas - is a purpose-built whitewater park in Watts, Oklahoma, just across the state line from Siloam Springs, Arkansas. The 1,200-foot long, 100-foot wide side channel of the Illinois River features eight engineered drop features designed for kayakers, surfers, and tubers of all abilities. Unlike theme park wave pools, WOKA offers authentic river conditions with real current and natural consequences. The park emphasizes that this is genuine whitewater - expect to get wet, tired, and maybe a little scraped up.
