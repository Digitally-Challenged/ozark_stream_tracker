# WOKA Whitewater Park

**Gradient:** Constructed features
**Length:** 1,200 feet

## Description
WOKA sits right on the line between Oklahoma and Arkansas, a twelve-hundred-foot channel carved out to give you reliable whitewater when the Illinois River is running. It might be engineered, but don't call it a theme park. You've got eight drops designed to mimic the real thing, creating waves and holes that'll tumble you just the same as a natural river. It's a place to hone your skills or just play, but remember - the current is real, the rocks are real concrete, and the water doesn't care if you paid for parking.
