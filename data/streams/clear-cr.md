# Clear Cr.

## Overview
**Rating:** II-III
**TDCR:** 3333
**Gradient:** 30-40 fpm
**Length:** 3 miles
**Season:** FLOOD
**Topo Quads:** Crawford County

## Description
First two-thirds runs Clear Creek proper – fast water, good Class II+ drops coming at you steady. There's a surf wave right below the put-in bridge that'll stand your boat on end if the water's up. Another beauty half a mile down.

Think Lee Creek but squeezed tighter. Watch for construction debris around the I-540 bridges and rebar hanging off the old train trestle – interstate work left its mark here. Below the trestle there's a ledge in a Class II rapid that makes a fine spot for playing around, spinning out if you've got the skill.

Then Frog Bayou comes in and everything changes. Flow triples, the creek becomes a river, and you've got heavy Class II+ water for the next three-quarters of a mile. It's a different animal entirely.

Whole run takes less than two hours. Quick hit of whitewater near Chester, then you're done.
