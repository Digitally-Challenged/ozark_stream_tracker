## Description

Left Hand Prong comes in where the North Fork of Illinois Bayou splits off, and it runs considerably harder than its parent stream. Class II to IV depending on the section, depending on the water. This is advanced paddling - the kind where you scout more than you boat, where every eddy matters.

While Illinois Bayou proper runs friendly enough for beginners, Left Hand Prong asks different questions. The gradient's steeper, the consequences sharper. It's what happens when an Ozark creek decides it's got something to prove.
