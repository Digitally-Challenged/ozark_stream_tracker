## Description

Lee Creek runs Class II+ most days and sees more boats than just about any northwest Arkansas creek. Popular doesn't always mean best, but Lee's earned its traffic - reliable water, good teaching current, nothing too mean when you're learning to read waves.

Section 2 (S2) is one of the most popular play runs in the area, covering 1.5 miles with fun to be found at almost any runnable level. Named rapids on S2 include Football Field Rapids (a 100-yard long series of ledges), El Horrendo, Surfing Ledges, and Buck-N-Flush (once an infamous stopper hole).

What makes Lee matter beyond its own paddling is the gauge. When you're wondering if Blackburn's running, if Clear Creek's up, if Ben Doodle's worth the drive - you check Lee Creek. The gauge at Highway 220 tells the story for half the creeks in Crawford County. That's where Blackburn comes in too, where Section 2 starts.

The creek's friendly at normal levels. When it climbs past ten feet, a hydraulic forms where Hart Creek feeds in - locals call it the "Hole-o-death," which is darkly practical naming. Past fifteen feet and those Blackburn strainers turn from obstacles into something considerably worse.

- Over 15 feet, strainers on Blackburn go from hazardous to lethal

## Gauge Information

- Above 6.5 feet: Possible run on Blackburn Creek
- Above 7.5 feet: Better conditions with even rainfall
- Over 10-12 feet: Dangerous hydraulic at Hart Creek confluence
- Over 15 feet: Death trap conditions on Blackburn due to strainers
- 15+ feet: Good level for Ben Doodle Creek
