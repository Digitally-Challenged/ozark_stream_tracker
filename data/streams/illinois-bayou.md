## Description
Illinois Bayou runs friendly, the kind of water that won't punish your mistakes too hard. Class II chop and splash, nothing that'll keep you up at night. You'll find willow tangles and a few rock gardens, but mostly it's just good moving water through the hills.

Left Hand Prong feeds in from the north - that's a different animal altogether, Class II to IV depending on where you catch it. But the main stem here, this is where you learn to read current without getting schooled too hard. The creek takes new paddlers and gives them back with a little more confidence than they came with.
