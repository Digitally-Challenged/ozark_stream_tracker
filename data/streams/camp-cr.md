# Camp Creek

## Overview
**Rating:** Class IV+
**Watershed Size:** S
**Gradient:** Steep
**Length:** Short steep run
**Season:** Rain-dependent

## Description
Camp Creek don't run often, but when the Little Missouri's up and the rain's falling right, this steep tributary comes alive. You're looking at class IV+ water that asks a lot of you - tight drops, technical moves, and the kind of commitment you only find in the deep Ouachitas. It rises fast and drops faster, so you better be at the put-in when the window opens. This ain't for the faint of heart.
