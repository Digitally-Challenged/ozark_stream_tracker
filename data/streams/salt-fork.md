## Description
The Salt Fork runs class II and III when the clouds open up. Like a lot of these smaller creeks, it needs a good rain to wake up, but when it does, it offers a tighter, more personal run than the bigger rivers. You'll find yourself in closer quarters here, reading water that moves fast and leaves less room for error. The details might be scarce, but the water's real enough when you're in it.
