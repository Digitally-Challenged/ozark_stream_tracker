## Description

The Caddo winds its way through the Ouachitas from Black Springs down to DeGray, and you'll find it's some of the best floating water in the state. It's got a pool-and-drop rhythm that treats you right - gentle enough for the family but with enough class I and II ripples to keep you awake. The water runs clear over gravel bars perfect for a lunch stop, with rocky outcrops and green hillsides watching you pass. It's an honest river for honest paddling.
