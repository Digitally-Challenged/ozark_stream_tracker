## Description
Thomas Creek runs class III-IV through Arkansas hill country, one of those creeks you hear about in passing from someone who heard about it from someone else. The kind of run that stays off most people's radar until the water comes up, then a few boats appear like they were just waiting for the call.

If you can find it and catch it running, you'll understand why the locals keep it quiet.
