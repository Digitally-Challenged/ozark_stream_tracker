# Hurricane Creek

## Overview
**Rating:** Class II-III (Franklin County), Class II-III+ (Newton/Pope County)
**Watershed Size:** S-M
**Gradient:** Moderate to steep
**Length:** Variable by section
**Season:** Rainfall dependent

## Description
Arkansas has this habit of naming creeks after storms, which is how you end up with multiple Hurricane Creeks running through different valleys. The Franklin County version flows out of Shores Lake down to the Mulberry at Highway 215, just above I-40 at Alma. Class II-III water that doesn't see as many boats as it probably should.

The Newton/Pope County Hurricane Creek is a different animal - runs from Cub Creek ten miles down to Big Piney, class II to III+, more technical than its western cousin. Not far from Harrison if you know where to look.

Both decent runs. Neither one particularly famous. Sometimes the best water's the water nobody's talking about.
