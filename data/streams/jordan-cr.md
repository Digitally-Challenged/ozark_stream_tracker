## Description

Jordan Creek comes in at Class III+, which means it expects you to know what you're doing before you point your bow downstream. This is intermediate water with teeth - the kind of creek that stays in your memory whether you styled the line or swam the meat.

Not much written about Jordan, which is sometimes how it goes with Arkansas creeks. The good ones stay quiet until somebody finds them, runs them, and decides whether to talk.
