## Description

A gem of an Ozark creek run, Osage Creek delivers 6 miles of class III-IV whitewater with an average gradient of 80 feet per mile - though the first 2 miles drop at 130 fpm, setting the tone early. This is technical, committing water with named rapids that have earned their reputation through broken paddles, side pins, vertical pins, lost skin, and bruised egos.

The run features several significant drops: Starting Gun (III) kicks things off with a 7-foot fall. Old Mill Falls follows with an 8-foot plunge over an old dam. Then the creek gets serious with Bottleneck (IV), Howler (IV), and the biggest challenge - Magic Mushroom, also called Moon Landing (IV) - distinguished by a huge mushroom-shaped rock that defines the rapid.

At really high levels, the combination of tricky entrances and thundering main falls may push certain rapids to class V. This is water for paddlers who've moved past intermediate and are ready for something with teeth. Come ready to scout, come ready to work, and you'll get the kind of day that reminds you why you paddle.
