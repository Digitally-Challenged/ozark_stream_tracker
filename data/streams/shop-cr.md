## Description
Shop Creek runs class III-V, and when other creek descriptions say you need skills "on par with Beech or Shop Creek," you know you're talking about serious water. This is benchmark expert territory in Arkansas - the kind of run that separates folks who think they're ready from folks who actually are. The creek doesn't give much quarter, and it expects you to show up with your A-game and the judgment to know when you've got it.
