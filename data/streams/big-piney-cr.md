# Big Piney Creek

## Overview

**Rating:** Class I-III (Class III+ at high water)
**Watershed Size:** L
**Gradient:** Variable by section
**Length:** 67 miles total, ~36.8 miles paddleable
**Season:** Late fall to early summer (rainfall dependent)

## Description

The water runs that creme de menthe green you only see in the Ozarks – something about the limestone, they say. Big Piney forms east of Limestone in the Ozark National Forest, then winds 67 miles south-southeast through Pope and Johnson Counties to Lake Dardanelle on the Arkansas River.

You'll paddle through willow jungles thick enough to swallow a canoe, past rocky shoals and boulder gardens that'll keep you honest. The creek earned Wild & Scenic designation in 1992 – 45 miles of it, longest of seven such rivers in Arkansas. That designation means the government agrees with what paddlers already knew.

Big Piney forms up in the Boston Mountains close to the headwaters of Hailstone, Kings, and Mulberry Rivers. Good company to keep. The creek's got about 37 miles of paddleable water split into sections, from class I-II up top to class II-III+ when the hills crowd in at Treat and things get serious.

## Sections

### Limestone to Highway 123

- **Distance:** ~10 miles
- **Rating:** Class I-II

### Highway 123 to Treat

- **Distance:** ~8 miles
- **Rating:** Class I-II
- **Notes:** Rapids more subdued, all Class I and II varieties.

### Treat to Long Pool

- **Distance:** ~10 miles
- **Rating:** Class II-III (up to III+ at high water)
- **Notes:** Where the stream has earned its reputation among whitewater enthusiasts. Hills crowd the creek for space, resulting in continuous action with rapids named "Roller Coaster," "Surfing Hole," and "Cascades of Extinction." This is considered a class II-solid III strip of water.

- **Distance:** ~5 miles
