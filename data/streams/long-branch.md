## Description
Long Branch feeds into the East Fork Little Buffalo running Class III to V, which is expert water by any measure. This isn't a creek you stumble onto - it's the kind of tributary you seek out after you've earned the right to paddle it, after you've swum enough easier water to know what serious consequences look like.

The lack of information isn't an oversight. Expert runs tend to document themselves in stories told around campfires, not in guidebooks. You find Long Branch by knowing someone who knows someone, and you run it because you've proven you can handle what it's offering.
