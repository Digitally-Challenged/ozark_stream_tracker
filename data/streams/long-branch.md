## Description
Long Branch feeds into the East Fork Little Buffalo running Class III to V, which is expert water by any measure. The gradient tells the story: 285 feet per mile overall, but the last 0.4 miles on Long Branch drops at 450 feet per mile. The last half mile of the creek is essentially one long steep complex rapid.

Named drops include Duck and Cover, Baby Zwick's, and Switchback. The full run covers 2 miles on Long Branch plus 4.5 miles on EFLB.

This isn't a creek you stumble onto - it's the kind of tributary you seek out after you've earned the right to paddle it, after you've swum enough easier water to know what serious consequences look like. Expert runs tend to document themselves in stories told around campfires, not in guidebooks. You find Long Branch by knowing someone who knows someone, and you run it because you've proven you can handle what it's offering.
