## Description
Mormon Creek runs extremely steep at 330 feet per mile over 1.5 miles - class IV pushing to IV+ when it's up. The put-in starts one of the longest slides in the Ozarks at half a mile long. Named rapids include UH (6-8 feet), OH (12-15 feet near vertical), Snake Eyes (IV), Mammer Jammer (20-25 feet class IV+), Sycamore, and Bobsled.

The biggest challenge for a paddler will be stopping. At this gradient, momentum becomes your constant companion. This is expert water that asks for clean lines and good judgment, the kind of creek where you'll scout more than once and be glad you did. It doesn't advertise much, but the paddlers who know it treat it with respect.
