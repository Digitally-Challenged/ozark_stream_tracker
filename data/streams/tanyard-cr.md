## Description

Tanyard Creek runs mostly in the class III-IV range, but that V in parentheses isn't there for decoration. Somewhere in the run there's a drop that'll make you earn it, and you won't know if you're ready until you're looking at it.

The lack of details in the guidebooks is its own kind of detail. Scout thoroughly and paddle conservatively.
