# Buffalo National River

## Overview
**Rating:** Class I-III (varies by section, upper has most whitewater)
**Watershed Size:** L
**Gradient:** Variable by section
**Length:** ~135 miles from headwaters to White River
**Season:** Year-round, best flows spring and after rain

## Description
Congress made this the first National River back in '72. There's a reason for that – 135 miles of water running free through the Ozarks, no dams, no impoundments, just river doing what rivers do.

The Upper Buffalo is where you'll find the whitewater, along with bluffs that rise 500 to 700 feet over your head. Limestone cliffs worn smooth by time, sink holes opening up in the earth, springs pouring cold water from the rock. There are caves back in the hollows and waterfalls tumbling down after good rain. The rock formations here tell stories if you know how to listen.

As you drift downstream, the river spreads out and settles down. Middle sections run Class I-II, more forgiving water. By the time you reach the lower stretches near Buffalo City, it's mostly flatwater – wider pools, gentle current, the kind of paddling where you can put your oar across the gunwales and just watch the canyon walls slide by.

You'll find your run depending on what you're after. Technical drops up high, scenic floating down low, and a whole lot of river in between.
