## Description

First run April 5, 1999, and they barely made it down at low water with some rapids unrun. Ben Doodle holds the title for fastest and most difficult creek in Crawford County, and the steepest you can drive to without needing a helicopter.

Right at the put-in there's barbed wire, which means a 30-yard carry unless you want to meet "Doodle Slide" – 18 feet of drop that earned that fence. After that comes "Midget Maker," a 12-foot blind drop. "Atom Smasher" splits 40-plus feet of total vertical into pieces. Then "Tenderizer" and "Masticator" – an 18-foot class V drop in a section that's losing 700 feet per mile. The names tell you what the rapids do.

Below the big hits, you've got continuous class II-III until Ben Doodle dumps into flooded Blackburn Creek. This is serious Ozark creeking through ugly boulder piles with minimal room to maneuver. Budget 3-4 hours for navigating the gorge, and that's if things go smooth.

## Access Points

### Put-in

**Location:** Remote area off Highway 220 south of Lee Creek
**Directions:** Take Highway 220 south from Lee Creek (paved side) almost to top of hill. Turn on first major dirt road left (goes to Chester and Highway 71). Follow approximately 5 miles to four-way intersection. Take left switchback approximately 2 miles. Past RV hookup, take right fork downhill (or hike 1/8 mile if no 4WD) to creek.

### Take-out

**Location:** Highway 220 bridge over Lee Creek
**Directions:** Highway 220 bridge over Lee Creek.
