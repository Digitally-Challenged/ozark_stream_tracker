## Description

Whistlepost Creek earned its P rating the hard way - class V water with mandatory portages around whatever the creek decided you weren't going to run. This is commitment paddling, where the walk around a drop is part of the day's plan, not a sign of failure.

The kind of creek that separates folks who like the idea of hard whitewater from folks who actually run it.
