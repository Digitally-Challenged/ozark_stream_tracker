## Description
White Rock Creek runs class III-IV depending on the water level and your definition of either. The name tells you what you'll be looking at - pale limestone showing through clear Ozark water, right up until the gradient kicks in and you're too busy to appreciate geology.

Another one where the details come from the people who've been there, not from guidebooks. Ask around at the takeout on other creeks and eventually you'll find someone who knows.
