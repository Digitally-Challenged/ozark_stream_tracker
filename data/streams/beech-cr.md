## Description
They say it's quite possibly the toughest overall run in the Ozarks, and the people saying that aren't the type to exaggerate. First complete run probably happened Fall of '86 with Jeff Green's group, which should tell you how long it took before anyone strung it all together.

The rapids run long, continuous, and demanding through a gorge so remote it's almost inaccessible. Penalties for mistakes are severe, which is a polite way of saying the creek doesn't give you many second chances. First mile's called "Jungle Gym" and there's a nasty hole 30 yards from the put-in, just so you know what you're in for.

You'll find Beech Ball, a class IV that lives up to its name. White Lightning – a long slide with waves big enough to make you religious. Beech Falls, another class IV ledge. And dozens of other long, technical drops that nobody bothered to name because they figured if you're on Beech Creek, you're already committed.

This run needs expert-level skills, the fitness to back them up, and the ability to make no mistakes on continuous difficult whitewater. Arguably the most difficult overall run in the Midwest, if you're keeping score.
