# Dragover (Ouachita River)

## Overview

**Rating:** Class I-II
**Watershed Size:** L
**Gradient:** Gentle
**Length:** 3.5 miles (horseshoe loop)
**Season:** Year-round when levels permit

## Description

The Dragover is one of Arkansas's most unique floats - a 3-mile horseshoe bend on the Upper Ouachita River where the put-in and take-out are only a quarter mile apart. The name comes from the option to literally drag your boat over from the take-out back to the put-in for another lap. Deep pools, Class I-II rapids, and the convenience of a short shuttle make this a perfect beginner-friendly destination. You can paddle the loop in about 90 minutes, making multiple runs in a day easy.
