# Dependency Audit

This document provides an initial analysis of the project's dependencies as listed in `package.json`. A more detailed audit (security vulnerabilities, update needs) will be part of Phase 3.

## Key Dependencies (`dependencies`)

- **`@emotion/react` & `@emotion/styled`**: CSS-in-JS libraries. Primarily used by Material UI for styling its components.
    - *Observation*: Essential for Material UI's operation.
- **`@mui/icons-material`**: Provides Material Design icons as React components.
    - *Observation*: Used alongside `lucide-react`. Potential to consolidate icon libraries.
- **`@mui/material`**: Material UI component library. Provides a wide range of pre-built UI components (Buttons, Dialogs, Tables, etc.) and a theming system.
    - *Observation*: Forms a core part of the UI. Its interaction with Tailwind CSS needs careful review for optimization.
- **`date-fns`**: Modern JavaScript date utility library.
    - *Observation*: Used for date formatting (e.g., in `StreamDetail.tsx`). Good choice.
- **`lucide-react`**: A library of simply beautiful open-source icons.
    - *Observation*: Used for some icons (e.g., theme toggle). Potential to consolidate with `@mui/icons-material`.
- **`react` & `react-dom`**: Core React libraries (v18.3.1).
    - *Observation*: Up-to-date.
- **`react-error-boundary`**: A reusable React error boundary component.
    - *Observation*: Good practice for error handling.
- **`react-router-dom`**: DOM bindings for React Router, used for navigation (v6.22.1).
    - *Observation*: Standard choice for routing in React applications.

## Key Development Dependencies (`devDependencies`)

- **`@eslint/js`, `eslint`, `typescript-eslint`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`**: ESLint and related plugins for code linting and quality checking.
    - *Observation*: Modern ESLint setup.
- **`@tailwindcss/forms`, `@tailwindcss/typography`, `tailwindcss`**: Tailwind CSS and official plugins.
    - *Observation*: Used for utility-first styling. Its co-existence with Material UI's styling system is a key area for review. `tailwind.config.js` attempts to sync its theme with MUI.
- **`@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`**: TypeScript type definitions for React.
- **`@vitejs/plugin-react`**: Vite plugin for React.
- **`autoprefixer`, `postcss`**: PostCSS tools for CSS processing (e.g., vendor prefixes for Tailwind).
- **`typescript`**: TypeScript language (v5.5.3).
- **`vite`**: Build tool (v5.4.2).

## Initial Concerns & Areas for Review (Phase 2 & 3)
- **Styling Redundancy/Complexity**: The use of both Material UI (with Emotion) and Tailwind CSS. While `tailwind.config.js` attempts to harmonize them, this can lead to:
    - Increased bundle size.
    - Steeper learning curve for developers.
    - Potential for inconsistent styling if not managed carefully.
    - Overriding styles can become complex.
- **Multiple Icon Libraries**: `lucide-react` and `@mui/icons-material`. Consolidating to one could simplify dependencies and potentially reduce bundle size slightly.
- **Missing Test Setup**: No dependencies for testing frameworks like Jest or React Testing Library are present. This is a critical gap for production readiness.
- **`npm audit`**: Will need to be run in Phase 3 to check for vulnerabilities.
- **Package Updates**: Versions should be checked against latest stable releases in Phase 3.
